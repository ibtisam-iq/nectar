# Servers

This folder documents how different servers actually run and behave in practice.

It includes application servers and databases — how to start them, configure them, connect to them, and run them locally, with Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes.

Each server folder captures the operational knowledge needed to work with it, not just install it.
