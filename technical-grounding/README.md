# Technical Grounding

This folder contains the foundational knowledge I built while learning how systems actually work.

It covers core building blocks — basics of software, Linux, networking, scripting, YAML, and how real codebases are structured — learned from zero and refined over time.

This is not a completed phase.
As my grounding deepens, related knowledge continues to be added here.
