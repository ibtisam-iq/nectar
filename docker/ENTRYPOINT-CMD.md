# ENTRYPOINT and CMD

## ENTRYPOINT

The `ENTRYPOINT` directive in a Dockerfile is used to define the executable that always runs when the container starts. This ensures consistent behavior for the container's main process.

- **Purpose:** Sets the command to execute when the container starts.
- **Behavior:** The `ENTRYPOINT` command is mandatory and always executed.
- **Example:**
  ```dockerfile
  # Define the entry point for the container
  ENTRYPOINT ["executable"]

  # Example: Always run the Python3 interpreter when the container starts
  ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
  ```

---

## CMD

The `CMD` directive specifies the default arguments or commands to pass to the `ENTRYPOINT`. If `ENTRYPOINT` is not defined, `CMD` directly runs as the container's command.

- **Purpose:** Defines the default command or arguments for the container's executable.
- **Behavior:** Only one `CMD` instruction is allowed in a Dockerfile. If multiple are present, only the last one takes effect.
- **Example:**
  ```dockerfile
  # Specifies the default argument for ENTRYPOINT or the default command to execute
  CMD ["app.py"]

  # Run specific commands
  CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

  # Example with Python3 and a script
  ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
  CMD ["app.py"]

  # Another example with npm start
  ENTRYPOINT ["npm"]
  CMD ["start"]
  ```

## When to Use Which?

### 1. When to Use ENTRYPOINT?

Use `ENTRYPOINT` when you always want the container to run a specific command, making it behave like an executable. This is useful when your container is designed for a dedicated task, such as running a web server, database, or agent.

**Use Case:**  
- Running an Nginx web server.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM nginx
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
**Explanation:**
Every time the container starts, it runs `nginx -g "daemon off;"`, ensuring that the Nginx server starts.

**Command to Run the Container:**
```bash
docker run -d my-nginx
```
The container will always start Nginx, regardless of any command-line arguments passed.

---

### 2. When to Use CMD?

Use `CMD` when you want to provide a default command that users can override at runtime.

**Use Case:**
- Running a Python script but allowing flexibility to execute different scripts.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```
**Explanation:**
By default, `app.py` will run when the container starts, but users can override it.

**Command to Run the Container:**
```bash
docker run my-python-app
```
(Default behavior: runs `python3 app.py`)

**Override CMD at Runtime:**
```bash
docker run my-python-app python3 another_script.py
```
`CMD` is replaced by `python3 another_script.py`.

---

### 3. When to Use Both ENTRYPOINT and CMD Together?

Use both when you want a fixed entry command (`ENTRYPOINT`) but allow flexible arguments (`CMD`).

**Use Case:**
- Running a Python interpreter but allowing different scripts as arguments.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```
**Explanation:**
`ENTRYPOINT` forces the container to always run `python3`. `CMD` provides a default script (`app.py`) that can be overridden.

**Command to Run the Container:**
```bash
docker run my-python-container
```
(Default behavior: runs `python3 app.py`)

**Override CMD at Runtime:**
```bash
docker run my-python-container another_script.py
```
`python3 another_script.py` runs instead.

### 4. How Overriding Works?

| Case                       | ENTRYPOINT       | CMD            | Run Behavior                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Only CMD                   | Not Set          | ["app.py"]     | Runs `app.py`                                     |
| Only ENTRYPOINT            | ["python3"]      | Not Set        | Runs `python3` (without arguments)                |
| Both ENTRYPOINT + CMD      | ["python3"]      | ["app.py"]     | Runs `python3 app.py`                             |
| Override CMD               | ["python3"]      | ["app.py"]     | `docker run my-python-container script.py` → Runs `python3 script.py` |
| Override ENTRYPOINT        | ["python3"]      | ["app.py"]     | `docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash my-python-container` → Runs 

bash

 |

**Override ENTRYPOINT at Runtime:**
```bash
docker run --entrypoint /bin/sh my-python-container
```
Runs a shell instead of `python3`.

**Override Both ENTRYPOINT and CMD:**
```bash
docker run --entrypoint node my-python-container server.js
```
Runs `node server.js` instead of `python3 app.py`.

---

## Best Practices:

- Use `ENTRYPOINT` when the container is an executable (e.g., `nginx`, `python3`, `java`).
- Use `CMD` when you need a default command that users can override (e.g., `python3 app.py`).
- Use both together when you want a fixed command with flexible arguments.
- Override `CMD` by passing arguments to `docker run`.
- Override `ENTRYPOINT` using `--entrypoint`.

---

## Additional Notes

### 1. ENTRYPOINT and CMD Together

- **ENTRYPOINT** specifies the executable.
- **CMD** provides the arguments for the executable.

**Example:**
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello, sweetheart"]
```
When the container starts, it will execute:
```bash
echo Hello, sweetheart
```

### 2. Multiple CMDs

- A Dockerfile cannot have multiple `CMD` instructions executed simultaneously.
- Only the last `CMD` instruction will take effect.

---

## Combining Commands in CMD

### Option 1: Use Shell Form

You can use the shell form of `CMD` to chain multiple commands:
```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "npm start && python3 app.py && echo 'Hello, sweetheart'"]
```

### Option 2: Use an Entrypoint Script

You can create a shell script to handle multiple commands, copy it into the container, and set it as the `CMD`:

1. **Create the script:**
```bash
# entrypoint.sh
npm start
python3 app.py
echo "Hello, sweetheart"
```

2. **Use the script in the Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
```

3. Alternatively, use a different script:
```dockerfile
COPY run_commands.sh /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run_commands.sh
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/run_commands.sh"]
```
