# How to Choose the Right Base Image for Multi-Stage Builds?

When choosing base images in a multi-stage Docker build, it depends on:
- ✅ The project’s programming language (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
- ✅ The role of each stage (Build stage vs. Final stage)
- ✅ Performance & security needs (Size, dependencies, vulnerabilities)

---

## 🔹 General Rule: Build Stage vs. Final Stage

| Stage       | Purpose                                      | Typical Base Images                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build Stage | Compiles the application, installs dependencies | Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu, official language images (node, golang, python, maven, etc.) |
| Final Stage | Runs the application efficiently             | Alpine, Distroless, Nginx, Scratch (minimal, optimized)                             |

## 📌 How to Decide?

### 👉 Is the project compiled (like Go, Java)?
- ➡️ Use a heavy image in the build stage (e.g., golang, maven, node)
- ➡️ Use a lightweight runtime in the final stage (e.g., scratch, distroless, nginx)

### 👉 Does the project need an interpreter (like Python, Node.js)?
- ➡️ Use a full OS base in the final stage (e.g., python:slim, node:alpine)

### 👉 Does the project serve static files?
- ➡️ Use nginx in the final stage

### 👉 Is security & size a priority?
- ➡️ Use alpine or distroless

## 📌 Project-Specific Examples

### 🔹 Example 1: Node.js (React/Vue) Frontend with Nginx

**Why?**
Node.js needed for npm build, but runtime should be lightweight (nginx).

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Final stage (only static files)
FROM nginx:alpine AS final
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
- ✅ Node.js used only for building → Nginx serves final static site
- ✅ Faster, smaller, no unnecessary Node.js runtime

---

### 🔹 Example 2: Java Spring Boot with OpenJDK

**Why?**
Maven used for build, but only JDK runtime needed in final stage.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Final stage (runtime only)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/target/myapp.jar /app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```
- ✅ Maven used only in build stage
- ✅ Final stage is much smaller, without Maven tools

---

### 🔹 Example 3: Python Flask App

**Why?**
Python used for both build and runtime but optimized with python:slim.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Build and runtime in one (smallest possible image)
FROM python:3.11-slim AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```
- ✅ No need for multi-stage if runtime = build
- ✅ Uses a slim image for security & size

---

### 🔹 Example 4: Golang App (Fully Compiled)

**Why?**
Go compiles to a single binary, so final stage needs nothing except execution.

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Final stage (smallest possible)
FROM scratch AS final
COPY --from=build /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```
- ✅ Final image contains only the binary, no OS, no extra files
- ✅ Extremely small (~10MB vs. 100+MB)

## 🔥 Key Takeaways

1️⃣ Pick a build image based on project dependencies (Node.js, Maven, Golang, etc.)
2️⃣ Pick a final image based on runtime needs (Alpine, Distroless, Nginx, Scratch, Slim, etc.)
3️⃣ Optimize for size & security
4️⃣ Always remove unnecessary dependencies from the final image
