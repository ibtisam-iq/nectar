# What are STDOUT and STDERR?

In Unix-like operating systems, every process or command generates three standard streams for input and output:

## STDOUT (Standard Output):
This is where a program sends its normal output (results, responses, or information that it needs to display).

## STDERR (Standard Error):
This is where a program sends its error messages (warnings, errors, or issues it encounters).

Both streams are represented as file descriptors in the background:
- **STDOUT** is file descriptor 1
- **STDERR** is file descriptor 2

By default, both streams are displayed on the terminal.

---

## Example 1: STDOUT (Normal Output)
Let's look at a simple example of a command that generates normal output (STDOUT):

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

**Output (STDOUT):**
```
Hello, World!
```

In this case, the command `echo` outputs the text `Hello, World!` to the terminal. This is **STDOUT** because it’s the normal, expected output of the command.

---

## Example 2: STDERR (Error Output)
Now, let's look at an example of a command that generates an error (STDERR):

```bash
ls non_existent_directory
```

**Output (STDERR):**
```
ls: cannot access 'non_existent_directory': No such file or directory
```

Here, the `ls` command is trying to list a directory that doesn’t exist. The error message `cannot access 'non_existent_directory': No such file or directory` is printed to **STDERR** because it’s an error, not normal output.

---

## Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR

You can redirect these outputs to different places, like a file or `/dev/null` (to discard the output). Here's how you can redirect each:

### 1. Redirect STDOUT (Normal Output):
If you only want to redirect the normal output (STDOUT) to a file:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```

**Result:**
The `output.txt` file will contain:
```
Hello, World!
```

But, if there was an error generated in this case (e.g., trying to write to a file you don't have permission to), the error would still be shown on the terminal because we haven’t redirected **STDERR**.

---

### 2. Redirect STDERR (Error Output):
To redirect the error output (STDERR) to a file:

```bash
ls non_existent_directory 2> error.txt
```

**Result:**
The `error.txt` file will contain:
```
ls: cannot access 'non_existent_directory': No such file or directory
```

But the normal output (if any) will still be printed on the terminal.

---

### 3. Redirect Both STDOUT and STDERR:
You can redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to the same place (e.g., a file or `/dev/null`):

To redirect both to a file:

```bash
ls non_existent_directory > output.txt 2>&1
```

This will redirect both normal output and error messages to `output.txt`.

To discard both STDOUT and STDERR (suppress everything):

```bash
ls non_existent_directory > /dev/null 2>&1
```

This will suppress all output and errors, so nothing is printed to the terminal.

---

## Visualizing STDOUT and STDERR:
Here’s a visualization of what happens when you run a command in a terminal:

### Normal Output (STDOUT):
```shell
$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!  <-- This is STDOUT
```

### Error Output (STDERR):
```pgsql
$ ls non_existent_directory
ls: cannot access 'non_existent_directory': No such file or directory  <-- This is STDERR
```

---

## Summary:
- **STDOUT** is the normal output stream that contains the expected result of a command.
- **STDERR** is the error output stream that contains error messages when things go wrong.
- By redirecting these streams, you can control where the output goes (file, terminal, etc.) and decide which type of output you want to suppress or capture.
