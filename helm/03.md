# Helm Notes — Section 3: Helm as a Package Manager (Pre-Built Charts)

## 3.1 What This Section Covers

Helm can be used as a **package manager** to install and manage existing charts (applications/controllers) from repositories — similar to `apt` or `yum` for Linux.

This section covers:

* Searching charts
* Adding/removing repositories
* Installing/upgrading from repos
* Installing specific versions
* Using alternative install methods (`helm pull`)
* Practical examples for CKA exam context

```bash
## 3.2 Searching Charts on Artifact Hub

Artifact Hub ([https://artifacthub.io/](https://artifacthub.io/)) is the central registry for Helm charts.

**Example:** Find `nginx` charts:


# Search directly on Artifact Hub website
# OR search from CLI using the hub plugin
helm search hub nginx
```

This searches the global hub, not your local repos.

---

## 3.3 Adding a Repository

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

* **bitnami**: Local alias for the repo
* URL: Location of chart index

---

## 3.4 Listing All Repositories

```bash
helm repo list
```

Shows all repos your cluster knows about.

---

## 3.5 Removing a Repository

```bash
helm repo remove bitnami
```

Removes the repo alias and its index.

---

## 3.6 Searching in Local Repos

```bash
helm search repo nginx
```

Searches only the repos you have added locally.

---

## 3.7 Installing from a Repo

```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```

* `my-nginx`: Release name in cluster
* `bitnami/nginx`: repo/chart name

---

## 3.8 Installing a Specific Version

```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx --version 9.3.5
```

Useful when you need exact chart versions.

---

## 3.9 Upgrading from a Repo

```bash
helm upgrade my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```

Upgrades the release to the latest available version.

---

## 3.10 Alternative Install Method: Pull & Untar

```bash
# Download chart to local
helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar

# Install from local directory
helm install my-nginx ./nginx
```

This method is useful for customizing before installation.

---

## 3.11 Uninstalling a Release

```bash
helm uninstall my-nginx
```

Removes all Kubernetes objects created by the chart.

---

## 3.12 Examples

1. **Install ingress-nginx from Bitnami repo**

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install ingress bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller
```

2. **Upgrade cert-manager from repo**

```bash
helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --version v1.11.0
```

---

✅ **Exam Tip**: Always run `helm repo update` before searching or installing to avoid outdated indexes.
