Your error:

```
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install: could not get information about the resource Service "" in namespace "frontend-apd": resource name may not be empty
```

This is happening because in your `service.yaml` you wrote:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.service.Name }}      # .name
```

But in Helm values, the key is usually lowercase (e.g. `service.name`), not `service.Name`.
Since `.Values.service.Name` doesnâ€™t exist in your `values.yaml`, it resolves to an **empty string**, so Helm tries to create a Service with no name â†’ error.

The chart URL and other specifications are as follows: -


1. The chart URL link - https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/

2. The chart repository name should be kubernetes-dashboard.

3. The release name should be kubernetes-dashboard-server.

4. All the resources should be deployed on the cd-tool-apd namespace.

```bash
root@student-node ~ âžœ  k create ns cd-tool-apd
namespace/cd-tool-apd created

```

Ahh I see what confused you ðŸ™‚ â€” the repetition you noticed
`kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard`

is **not a mistake**. Itâ€™s just how Helm names things:

* The **first part** (`kubernetes-dashboard/`) is the **repository name** you added with

  ```bash
  helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
  ```

* The **second part** (`kubernetes-dashboard`) is the **chart name** inside that repository.

So the pattern is always:

```
<repo-name>/<chart-name>
```

In your case:

* Repo name = `kubernetes-dashboard`
* Chart name = `kubernetes-dashboard`

Thatâ€™s why you see it repeated.
If the repo were named `foo`, youâ€™d install like this:

```
helm install my-release foo/kubernetes-dashboard
```

Great question ðŸ‘Œ â€” let me show you exactly how I got the chart name.

When you add a Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
helm repo update
```

You can **search charts in that repo** with:

```bash
helm search repo kubernetes-dashboard
```

Youâ€™ll get output like this:

```
NAME                                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard   6.x.x        2.x.x          General-purpose web UI for Kubernetes clusters
```

* The **first column (`NAME`)** shows `<repo-name>/<chart-name>`.
* In this case, the chart name **inside the repo** is `kubernetes-dashboard`.
* So, when installing, you reference both:

  ```bash
  helm install kubernetes-dashboard-server kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard -n cd-tool-apd
  ```

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
I got the chart name by running `helm search repo kubernetes-dashboard`, which shows you the charts available in that repo.

One co-worker deployed an nginx helm chart on the cluster3 server called lvm-crystal-apd. A new update is pushed to the helm chart, and the team wants you to update the helm repository to fetch the new changes.

Aha ðŸš€ I get what you mean now â€” you want to know **how I knew that the release is using the nginx chart**, not assuming it blindly.

That comes from your own `helm list -A` output ðŸ‘‡

```
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION   UPDATED   STATUS    CHART         APP VERSION
lvm-crystal-apd crystal-apd-ns  1          ...       deployed nginx-18.1.0  1.27.0
```

* In the **CHART** column, it clearly shows `nginx-18.1.0`.
* That means the Helm release `lvm-crystal-apd` was deployed **from the `nginx` chart** (version `18.1.0`).

### ðŸ”¹ Commands to verify chart source

1. **Show detailed release info**:

   ```bash
   helm status lvm-crystal-apd -n crystal-apd-ns
   ```

   This shows which chart was used, its version, and values applied.

2. **Inspect the chart directly**:

   ```bash
   helm get all lvm-crystal-apd -n crystal-apd-ns
   ```

   This dumps manifests, chart name, and values.

3. **List available versions of nginx in repo**:

   ```bash
   helm search repo lvm-crystal-apd/nginx
   ```

   Thatâ€™s how we know `18.1.15` exists.

One application, webpage-server-01, is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster by the Helm tool. Now, the team wants to deploy a new version of the application by replacing the existing one. A new version of the helm chart is given in the /root/new-version directory on the student-node. Validate the chart before installing it on the Kubernetes cluster. 
Use the helm command to validate and install the chart. After successfully installing the newer version, uninstall the older version. 

```bash

Perfect ðŸ‘Œ you already nailed the workflow! Let me recap and highlight the key points the exam usually wants:

### ðŸ”¹ Steps You Did (and why)

1. **Validate the chart before installing**

   ```bash
   helm lint ./new-version/
   ```

   âœ… Output showed no failures (just a warning about missing icon). That means the chart is valid.

2. **Upgrade the release with the new chart**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install webpage-server-01 ./new-version/
   ```

   âœ… This replaced the old version with the new one in the **same release name** (`webpage-server-01`), revision bumped to `2`.

   * `--install` makes sure if the release didnâ€™t exist, it would install.
   * In your case, since it existed, it upgraded instead.

3. **Check release**

   ```bash
   helm list -n default
   ```

   Youâ€™ll see `REVISION: 2`, confirming upgrade worked.

### ðŸ”¹ About uninstalling the old release

You donâ€™t actually need to uninstall the old one separately because `helm upgrade` overwrites it in place (keeping history).

But if the requirement is to **completely remove the old release and keep only the new one**, the sequence would have been:

```bash
helm uninstall webpage-server-01 -n default
helm install webpage-server-01 ./new-version/ -n default
```

This destroys the old release first, then installs fresh.

```bash
cluster3-controlplane ~ âœ– helm install nginx-server polar/nginx -n cd-tool-apd
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: failed to perform "FetchReference" on source: GET "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/bitnamicharts/nginx/manifests/21.1.23": response status code 429: toomanyrequests: You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit. https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit
```

Ahh âš¡ youâ€™ve hit the **Docker Hub rate limit** issue.

Whatâ€™s happening:

* Bitnamiâ€™s nginx chart pulls its container image (`bitnami/nginx`) from **Docker Hub**.
* Without authentication, Docker Hub only allows a limited number of pulls per 6 hours.
* You got `429: toomanyrequests` = rate limit exceeded.

### ðŸ”¹ Ways to Fix

#### Option 1: Create a Docker Hub account & login

This is the cleanest fix.

```bash
docker login
```

(or if only kubectl/helm is available):

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --docker-email=<your-email> \
  -n cd-tool-apd
```

Then patch your `ServiceAccount` or Helm values to use this secret for pulling images.

#### Option 2: Use Bitnamiâ€™s own container registry (quay.io or ghcr.io)

Bitnami also mirrors their images to other registries that donâ€™t have this limit.
For example, override values when installing:

```bash
helm install nginx-server polar/nginx \
  -n cd-tool-apd \
  --set image.registry=ghcr.io \
  --set image.repository=bitnami/nginx \
  --set image.tag=latest
```

This tells the chart to pull from **GitHub Container Registry** instead of Docker Hub.

#### Option 3: Wait (not great for exams ðŸ˜…)

Rate limits reset after 6 hours for anonymous pulls.

### âœ… Best Exam-Safe Command

If authentication isnâ€™t available, just switch registry:

```bash
helm install nginx-server polar/nginx \
  -n cd-tool-apd \
  --set image.registry=ghcr.io \
  --set image.repository=bitnami/nginx \
  --set image.tag=latest
```

---
`helm install --generate-name ./new-version`

We haven't got any release name in the task, so we can generate the random name from the `--generate-name` option.

name: webpage-server-02
```

Nice, you shared the chart ðŸ™Œ â€” now itâ€™s crystal clear why the Deployment comes out as `webpage-server-02`:

In **`deployment.yaml`**, the name is set like this:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
```

â€¦and in **`values.yaml`**, youâ€™ve got:

```yaml
name: webpage-server-02
```

So Helm is simply substituting the value, which explains the mismatch.

### ðŸ”§ How to tie it to the release name

Option **1 â€” simplest (exam friendly)**
Change the `deployment.yaml` line to:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}
```

Now, when you run:

```bash
helm upgrade --install webpage-server-01 /root/new-version
```

Your Deployment will be named **`webpage-server-01`**.

Option **2 â€” values-driven (best practice)**
Instead of hardcoding `name` in `values.yaml`, use Helmâ€™s built-in `fullnameOverride`.

1. In `values.yaml`, add:

```yaml
fullnameOverride: ""
```

2. In `deployment.yaml`, replace:

```yaml
name: {{ .Values.name }}
```

with:

```yaml
name: {{ include "new-version.fullname" . }}
```

â€¦and in `_helpers.tpl` (if your chart has it), `fullname` is usually defined like this:

```yaml
{{- define "new-version.fullname" -}}
{{- if .Values.fullnameOverride }}
{{- .Values.fullnameOverride | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}
{{- else }}
{{- .Release.Name }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

This way:

* By default, the Deployment will follow the release name (`webpage-server-01`).
* If you want to override, you just set `fullnameOverride` in `values.yaml`.

Exactly ðŸ’¯

If you switch to:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}
```

ðŸ‘‰ then you **donâ€™t need to add anything in `values.yaml`**.
`Release.Name` is a built-in Helm object â€” itâ€™s always available, no matter whatâ€™s in `values.yaml`.

So:

* `{{ .Values.* }}` â†’ pulls from your `values.yaml` (or from `--set`, `-f`).
* `{{ .Release.Name }}` â†’ comes directly from Helm itself (whatever name you used in `helm install <release-name> ...`).

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s often the easiest fix: you just tie the Deployment (and Service, ConfigMap, etc.) names to the release name, and you donâ€™t have to maintain a `name:` field in `values.yaml` at all.

ðŸ‘‰ Helm also ships with helpers like `fullnameOverride` and `nameOverride` (defined in `_helpers.tpl` when you create a chart with `helm create`). Those **are not built-in**, theyâ€™re just conventions that the starter chart scaffolds for you.
