## **Security Tab in Jenkins**

The **Security Tab** in Jenkins provides a centralized place for managing the security settings of your Jenkins instance, focusing on authentication and authorization.

### **Authentication**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access Jenkins. Jenkins supports several authentication methods, including:

- **Jenkinsâ€™ Own User Database**: Default authentication method where users are managed directly in Jenkins.
- **LDAP**: Integrates with corporate directories for centralized user management.

### **Authorization Modes**
Authorization determines what authenticated users are allowed to do in Jenkins. The main modes include:

1. **Matrix-based Security**:
   - Provides fine-grained control over permissions.
   - Allows administrators to assign specific permissions to individual users or groups.

2. **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy**:
   - Extends matrix-based security to individual projects.
   - Enables per-project access control for users and groups.

3. **Legacy mode**:
    - A simpler authorization method where users are assigned roles.
    - Less flexible than matrix-based security but easier to manage for small setups.

4. **Logged-in Users Can Do Anything**:
   - Grants full access to all logged-in users.
   - Suitable for small or trusted environments.

5. **Anyone Can Do Anything**:
   - Disables security entirely.
   - Suitable for non-critical environments or testing purposes.
