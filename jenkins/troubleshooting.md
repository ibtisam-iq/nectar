## Error 128: Git is Private, and the Token is Missing

### What is the Error?
Error code 128 occurs when Jenkins tries to access a private Git repository without the necessary authentication token.

   - Add a new credential with the token.
3. Update your Jenkins job to use the new credential for Git operations.
