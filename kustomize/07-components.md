# Kustomize Components

We have already seen how **bases** define reusable core resources and how **overlays** extend them for environment-specific use cases.
But sometimes overlays alone are not enough. This is where **components** come in.

---

## Why Components?

Overlays are designed to represent **environments** (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
But in real-world scenarios, we also need to manage **optional features** that may or may not be enabled, regardless of the environment.

For example:

* Enabling **monitoring** with Prometheus/Grafana.
* Adding **service mesh sidecars**.
* Applying **network policies** only in certain deployments.

Instead of duplicating this logic in each overlay, Kustomize introduced **components** to keep such reusable, optional features separate.

---

## What Is a Component?

* A **component** is like a mini-base, but it cannot stand alone.
* It must be combined with a base or an overlay.
* Inside a component, you define a `kustomization.yaml` that may contain:

  * Resources
  * Patches
  * Transformers
* However, unlike overlays, a component is not tied to a specific environment â€” it represents a **feature toggle**.

## Example Directory Structure

```
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ overlays/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dev/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prod/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grafana.yaml
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ network-policy/
        â”œâ”€â”€ netpol.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
```

---

## Example Component `kustomization.yaml`

**`components/monitoring/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component

resources:
  - grafana.yaml
```

Notice:

* The `kind` is **`Component`**, not `Kustomization`.
* This makes it different from bases and overlays.

---

## Using Components in an Overlay

To enable a component, reference it inside the overlayâ€™s `kustomization.yaml`:

**`overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/monitoring
  - ../../components/network-policy
```

Here:

* The **base** defines the core app.
* The **prod overlay** pulls in the base.
* Then **components** add monitoring and network policy features on top.

---

## Key Points About Components

* They solve the problem of **optional features** that overlays alone cannot handle.
* Defined with `kind: Component` instead of `kind: Kustomization`.
* Must always be used **with a base or overlay**; they cannot be deployed directly.
* They keep features modular, reusable, and composable across multiple environments.

---

## Kustomize Components â€“ Real World Case Study

To understand components more clearly, letâ€™s walk through a real-world case.

### Scenario

We have a web application that needs to run in **development** and **production**.
Both environments share the same base (Deployment + Service).

* **Development** should remain lightweight, without any additional overhead.
* **Production** must include:

  * **Monitoring** (Grafana)
  * **Network Policies** for security

Instead of duplicating this configuration inside the production overlay, we define these features as **components**.

### Directory Structure

```
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ overlays/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dev/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml

â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grafana.yaml
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ network-policy/
        â”œâ”€â”€ netpol.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
```

---

### Base `kustomization.yaml`

**`base/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
```

---

### Component Example â€“ Monitoring

**`components/monitoring/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component

resources:
  - grafana.yaml
```

---

### Component Example â€“ Network Policy

**`components/network-policy/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component

resources:
  - netpol.yaml
```

---

### Overlay â€“ Development

**`overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base
```

* Uses only the base.
* No additional monitoring or network policies.

---

### Overlay â€“ Production

**`overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`**

```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/monitoring
  - ../../components/network-policy
```

* Reuses the base app.
* Adds monitoring and network policy components.

---

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy development
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev

# Deploy production
kubectl apply -k overlays/prod
```

---

### Outcome

* **Development** â†’ App runs with only Deployment and Service.
* **Production** â†’ App runs with Deployment, Service, Grafana, and Network Policies.

This shows how components make it possible to **mix and match optional features** without duplicating configurations across overlays.

---

ðŸ‘‰ In summary:

* **Overlays** handle environment differences.
* **Components** handle optional, reusable features.
* Together, they give maximum flexibility in managing Kubernetes manifests.

A new `caching` component needs to be created for the application.

There is already a directory located at: `project_mercury/components/caching/`

This directory contains the following files:

- redis-depl.yaml
- redis-service.yaml
  
Finish setting up this component by creating a `kustomization.yaml` file in the same directory and importing the above Redis configuration files.

```bash
controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ  tree components/caching/
components/caching/
â”œâ”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ redis-depl.yaml
â””â”€â”€ redis-service.yaml

0 directories, 3 files

controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ  cat components/caching/kustomization.yaml 
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
resources:
  - redis-depl.yaml
  - redis-service.yaml
controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ 
```

With the database setup for the `caching` component complete, we now need to update the `api-deployment` so that it can connect to the Redis instance.

Create a **Strategic Merge Patch** to add the following environment variable to the container in the deployment:

- Name: REDIS_CONNECTION
- Value: redis-service

Note:

The patch file must be created at: `project_mercury/components/caching/ with name api-patch.yaml`

After creating the patch file, you must also update the `kustomization.yaml` file in the same directory (`components/caching/`) to include this patch under the patches field.

```bash
controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ  tree components/caching/
components/caching/
â”œâ”€â”€ api-patch.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ redis-depl.yaml
â””â”€â”€ redis-service.yaml

          env:

            value: redis-service

controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ  cat components/caching/kustomization.yaml 
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1

  - redis-depl.yaml
  - redis-service.yaml
patches:
# - api-patch.yaml             # wrong 
  - path: api-patch.yaml 
```

Finally, let's add the `caching` component to the `Enterprise` edition of the application.

```bash
controlplane ~/code/project_mercury âžœ  cat overlays/enterprise/kustomization.yaml 
bases:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/auth
  - ../../components/db
  - ../../components/caching
