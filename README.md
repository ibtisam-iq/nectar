# **Nectar**

### A DevOps Knowledge System Built From Real Struggle, Real Learning, and Real Engineering Thinking

---

## Why Nectar Exists

Nectar was not created as a typical “notes repository.”
It was born from **confusion, struggle, and pain**.

I come from a **non-technical background**. When I started learning DevOps, I faced problems most people don’t talk about:

- I didn’t understand basic technical words
- Official documentation felt like a foreign language
- Simple concepts felt impossible
- Most tutorials assumed a CS background

There was no structured path for someone like me.

So I built one.

## Who This Is For

This repository is built specifically for:

- Career switchers
- Non-technical background learners
- Beginners who feel lost in complex documentation
- Anyone who wants concepts explained like a human, not a textbook

If you’ve ever felt **overwhelmed, confused, or behind**, this repository was built for you.

---

## What Makes Nectar Different

This is **not copied content**.
This is **not theoretical documentation**.
This is **not based on memorization**.

Everything inside Nectar is:

- Written from first-principle understanding
- Built through real trial-and-error learning
- Explained using simple human logic
- Structured like a growing engineering brain

Every concept here was confusing to me once — and I wrote it in a way no longer confusing.

---

## Docker Section — A Real Example of Philosophy

The **Docker** folder represents the heart of Nectar.

When I started, I didn’t understand:

- What a container was
- What a volume meant
- Why images exist
- What “mounting” means

Even official Docker documentation confused me.

So I used a different method:

I took confusing concepts →
I broke them down →
I translated them into simple language →
Then I documented them here.

The Docker folder is written not as a teacher, but as **someone who once didn’t understand**.

That makes this repository honest — not artificial.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured by real engineering domains:

```
docker/
kubernetes/
aws/
linux/
jenkins/
trivy/
sonarqube/
bash/
terraform/
ci-cd/
```

Each folder contains:

- Concept breakdowns
- Step-by-step mental models
- Real problem understanding
- Clear learning flows

This is not random content.
It evolves with my engineering journey.

---

## How I Personally Use Nectar

This repository is my **engineering second brain**.

I use it to:

- Prepare for technical interviews
- Refresh forgotten concepts quickly
- Rebuild mental clarity before projects
- Avoid time-wasting re-learning

This is my knowledge system — not just notes.

---

## Why the Name “Nectar”

The name **Nectar** was chosen intentionally.

Nectar means:

- The essence of something
- The purest form of value
- The distilled version of complexity

This repository does not contain noise.
It contains **concentrated learning distilled through pain, effort, and discipline**.

That’s why it’s called **Nectar**.

---

## Future Vision

This project will continue to grow as:

- My engineering depth expands
- My real-world production experience increases
- My systems thinking evolves

My long-term vision is:

To help career switchers and non-technical learners become real engineers.
