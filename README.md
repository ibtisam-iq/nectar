# Nectar

Nectar is my personal engineering knowledge base.

It was **born from confusion, struggle, and pain**.

I built it because I didn’t have the luxury of assumed knowledge.

Coming from a non-traditional background, I couldn’t rely on intuition, shortcuts, or “you’ll understand later.” If something worked, I needed to know why. If something failed, I needed to know where and how.

So I wrote things down:

- Sometimes a full architecture.
- Sometimes a single command.
- Sometimes a mistake I didn’t want to repeat.

Over time, those notes became Nectar.

## What This Is

This repository reflects how I actually learn and think as an engineer.

When I encounter a new tool, system, or concept, I don’t approach it academically. I try to understand how it behaves when deployed, operated, misconfigured, stressed, or broken.

**Everything here was confusing to me once — and I wrote it in a way that removed that confusion.**

If I learn even one small thing that improves my understanding, I document it.

- Not to teach.
- Not to impress.
- But to retain clarity.

That habit, repeated over years, is what you see here.

## What This Is Not

- This is not a tutorial site.
- This is not copied documentation.
- This is not a certification dump.
- This is not optimized for beginners.

There is no fixed reading order and no guaranteed starting point — because real engineering work doesn’t happen in sequence.

## How I Use Nectar

I actively study from this repository.

I use it to compress large amounts of information into forms I can quickly revisit — sometimes reducing hundreds of pages of material into a few dense pages that only need to make sense to me.

I return to it when:

- I forget something I once understood
- I need to reconnect scattered concepts
- I want to reason through a system again
- I want to avoid repeating an old mistake

Some documents are intentionally dense and non-explanatory — built as personal “master keys” rather than teaching material (for example: [Kubernetes Master Key](containers-orchestration/kubernetes/master-key.md)).

## Engineering Philosophy

I couldn’t understand tools until I understood the problems they were created to solve.

That principle sits at the core of how I think as an engineer.

I don’t treat failures as disasters.
I treat them as engineering signals.

When something breaks, I slow down instead of rushing.
I observe instead of guessing.
I try to understand what actually failed, not just what stopped working.

I don’t depend on tools.
I depend on understanding.

Tools change.
Principles don’t.

## Why the Name “Nectar”

Nectar represents **distilled understanding**, not accumulation.

It reflects extracting essence after confusion, repetition, mistakes, and time — not collecting everything indiscriminately.

---

## Status

This repository is alive.

It grows when I learn.
It stays silent when I don’t.
It will never be finished.

And that’s the point.
