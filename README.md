# **Nectar**

### A DevOps Knowledge System Built From Real Struggle, Real Learning, and Real Engineering Thinking

---

## Why Nectar Exists

Nectar was not created as a typical “notes repository.”
It was born from **confusion, struggle, and pain**.

I come from a **non-technical background**. When I started learning DevOps, I faced problems most people don’t talk about:

• I didn’t understand basic technical words
• Official documentation felt like a foreign language
• Simple concepts felt impossible
• Most tutorials assumed a CS background

There was no structured path for someone like me.

So I built one.

## Who This Is For

This repository is built specifically for:

• Career switchers
• Non-technical background learners
• Beginners who feel lost in complex documentation
• Anyone who wants concepts explained like a human, not a textbook

If you’ve ever felt **overwhelmed, confused, or behind**, this repository was built for you.

---

## What Makes Nectar Different

This is **not copied content**.
This is **not theoretical documentation**.
This is **not based on memorization**.

Everything inside Nectar is:

• Written from first-principle understanding
• Built through real trial-and-error learning
• Explained using simple human logic
• Structured like a growing engineering brain

Every concept here was confusing to me once — and I wrote it in a way no longer confusing.

---

## Docker Section — A Real Example of Philosophy

The **Docker** folder represents the heart of Nectar.

When I started, I didn’t understand:

• What a container was
• What a volume meant
• Why images exist
• What “mounting” means

Even official Docker documentation confused me.

So I used a different method:

I took confusing concepts →
I broke them down →
I translated them into simple language →
Then I documented them here.

The Docker folder is written not as a teacher, but as **someone who once didn’t understand**.

That makes this repository honest — not artificial.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured by real engineering domains:

```
docker/
kubernetes/
aws/
linux/
jenkins/
trivy/
sonarqube/
bash/
terraform/
ci-cd/
```

Each folder contains:

• Concept breakdowns
• Step-by-step mental models
• Real problem understanding
• Clear learning flows

This is not random content.
It evolves with my engineering journey.

---

## How I Personally Use Nectar

This repository is my **engineering second brain**.

I use it to:

• Prepare for technical interviews
• Refresh forgotten concepts quickly
• Rebuild mental clarity before projects
• Avoid time-wasting re-learning

This is my knowledge system — not just notes.

---

## Why the Name “Nectar”

The name **Nectar** was chosen intentionally.

Nectar means:

• The essence of something
• The purest form of value
• The distilled version of complexity

This repository does not contain noise.
It contains **concentrated learning distilled through pain, effort, and discipline**.

That’s why it’s called **Nectar**.

---

## Future Vision

This project will continue to grow as:

• My engineering depth expands
• My real-world production experience increases
• My systems thinking evolves

My long-term vision is:

To help career switchers and non-technical learners become real engineers.
