# ----------------------------------------
#  GITATTRIBUTES FILE FOR CORPORATE PROJECTS
# ----------------------------------------

# --- TEXT FILE HANDLING ---
# Ensure consistent end-of-line (EOL) normalization across OS
# LF (Line Feed) is the standard for Unix/macOS
# CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) is common in Windows
# "text=auto" ensures Git converts files to the correct format based on OS

*.txt       text=auto
*.md        text=auto
*.csv       text=auto
*.json      text=auto
*.xml       text=auto
*.yaml      text=auto
*.yml       text=auto

# Prevent accidental conversion of Unix shell scripts to Windows CRLF
*.sh        text eol=lf

# Force Windows batch scripts to use CRLF
*.bat       text eol=crlf
*.cmd       text eol=crlf

# --- SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING OVERRIDES (GitHub Linguist) ---
# Prevent GitHub from applying syntax highlighting to certain text files
*.log       linguist-language=Text
*.out       linguist-language=Text
*.err       linguist-language=Text
*.txt       linguist-language=Text


# Force GitHub to detect files as specific languages
*.tf        linguist-language=HCL      # Treat Terraform files correctly
*.json      linguist-language=JSON     # Ensure JSON files are recognized properly
*.yml       linguist-language=YAML     # YAML should always be highlighted as YAML

# --- BINARY FILE HANDLING ---
# Mark images, fonts, and other binary files as non-diffable to improve performance
# Git will not attempt to process diffs for these files
*.png       binary
*.jpg       binary
*.jpeg      binary
*.gif       binary
*.ico       binary
*.ttf       binary
*.woff      binary
*.woff2     binary
*.pdf       binary
*.mp4       binary
*.mp3       binary
*.zip       binary
*.tar.gz    binary

# --- DIFF SETTINGS ---
# Prevent Git from generating diffs for large log or generated files
*.log       -diff
*.out       -diff
*.bin       -diff
*.pdf       -diff
*.exe       -diff
*.jar       -diff
*.class     -diff

# Customize diff behavior for specific files
# Git will use 'word diff' mode for Markdown and JSON to make reviews easier
*.md        diff=word
*.json      diff=word

# --- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS ---
# Speed up Git operations by treating large files as binary
*.iso       filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.tar       filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.gz        filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# --- EXCEPTIONS AND OVERRIDES ---
# Ensure Makefiles are always detected correctly
Makefile    linguist-language=Makefile

# Treat all .dat files as binary except in the `configs/` folder
*.dat       binary
configs/*.dat text

# Prevent version control of compiled Python files
*.pyc       -text
*.pyo       -text
__pycache__/ -text

# --- WINDOWS & MAC FILE IGNORANCE ---
# Ignore system-generated metadata files
*.DS_Store  -text
Thumbs.db   -text
