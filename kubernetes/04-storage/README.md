# Kubernetes Volumes: Deep Dive into PV, PVC, StorageClass

This documentation provides a production-grade understanding of Kubernetes storage management using Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and Storage Classes.

--- 

## üîç 1. What Is a "Mounted Volume"?

In Linux (and in Kubernetes), a **mounted volume** refers to **external storage** (like a directory or disk) that gets **attached** to a *specific location in the container‚Äôs filesystem* ‚Äî sort of like "plugging in a USB drive" and seeing it appear under `/mnt/usb` or `/media`.

In Kubernetes, mounted volumes are used to:

- Persist data **produced by the application inside the container**, such as logs, databases, or build artifacts 
- Share data between containers in the same Pod
- Inject configuration (like ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.) 

> When we say **"persist data"** using Kubernetes volumes, we‚Äôre referring to **any data generated inside the container** that you **don‚Äôt want to lose** when the Pod is deleted, restarted, or rescheduled.

#### üß† Real Analogy

Imagine a blank house. You bring a cabinet (volume) and place it inside the house‚Äôs kitchen (mountPath). Now, anything you store in that cabinet is persistent **because it‚Äôs not part of the house itself ‚Äî it's your external cabinet**.

### üîß Example: Mounted Volume in Kubernetes

Let‚Äôs say your Pod has a volume mounted like this:

```yaml
  volumeMounts:
    - name: demo-volume # This is the name of the volume, must match volumes.name
      mountPath: /data  # Also called mounted volume
volumes:
  - name: demo-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

This means: 
üì¶ A temporary volume (emptyDir) is created and mounted into the container's `/data` folder.

Now, when the container writes files into `/data`, it's writing them into the mounted volume.

---

### ü§î Where is `emptyDir` actually created? 

**`emptyDir` is created on the Node's filesystem** where the Pod is scheduled to run.

### üß† What does that mean?

- When your Pod starts, Kubernetes creates a **temporary directory on the Node's local storage** (like `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/.../volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/`).
- Then, that folder is **mounted into the container** at the `mountPath` you specify (e.g., `/data`).
- Any files the container writes to `/data` are actually being stored **on the Node** inside that temporary `emptyDir`. 

### üìå Key Properties of `emptyDir`:

| Property             | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Created On           | The **Node** where the Pod is scheduled                                     |
| Lifecycle            | **Tied to the Pod's lifecycle** ‚Äî deleted when the Pod is deleted           |
| Visibility           | Shared across all containers in the Pod (if they mount it)                  |
| Use Cases            | Temporary scratch space, inter-container file sharing, caching, etc.        |
| Backing Medium       | By default, it uses **disk** (but you can specify `medium: Memory`)         |

### üîç Diagram (Mental Model): 

```
[Node]
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ emptyDir volume (e.g., /var/lib/kubelet/pods/abc123/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/demo-volume)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mounted into container at /data
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Where `fsGroup` Comes In

By default, when the container writes files into `/data`, they are owned by the **user** running the container (say UID 1000), and group might be root or unset.

But if you define this in your Pod's `securityContext`:

```yaml
securityContext:
  fsGroup: 2000
```

Then Kubernetes **automatically changes the group ownership** of all files created **inside mounted volumes** (like `/data`) to GID 2000.

#### üîç Visual Example

Imagine your container creates a folder inside `/data`:

```bash
mkdir /data/demo
ls -l /data
```

#### Without `fsGroup`:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 root 4096 Apr 8 18:30 demo
```
üëé Group is root (not ideal for sharing)

#### With `fsGroup: 2000`:
```bash
drwxrwsrwx 2 1000 2000 4096 Apr 8 18:30 demo
```
üëç Now the group is set to **2000**, as expected

##### üß† Why Is This Important?

In multi-user environments or permission-sensitive apps, group ownership matters:

- Apps might expect files to be owned by a certain group.
- Security policies may restrict which group can access files.
- Shared access among containers may require group coordination.

So setting `fsGroup` helps **ensure correct access control** over mounted storage.

---

### Mounted Volumes

- **EmptyDir**: A temporary directory that exists only while the Pod is running.
- **HostPath**: A directory on the host machine.
- **ConfigMap**: A way to store configuration data as key-value pairs.
- **Secret**: A way to store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).
- **PersistentVolumeClaim**: A request for storage that can be fulfilled by a PersistentVolume.

---

## üì¶ 2. [PersistentVolume (PV)](pv-guide.md)

A **PersistentVolume (PV)** is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically by Kubernetes using a **StorageClass**. It‚Äôs a cluster-wide resource.

### Key Characteristics:

- Cluster-scoped object (not namespace-bound).
- Has details about **capacity, access modes, storage backend**, etc.
- Can be **manually created** (Static) or created on demand via **StorageClass** (Dynamic).

#### ‚ùó Key Hint
> If you **manually write a PV**, it‚Äôs static provisioning. If you only write a PVC and `StorageClass` handles volume creation, it‚Äôs dynamic.

---

## üìÑ 3. [PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)](pvc-guide.md)

A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user. It specifies *size*, *access modes*, and *storage class*. The **developer** or **app owner**, usually within a namespace, creates a PVC.

### Key Characteristics:

- Namespace-scoped object.
- Describes **how much space** is needed and **how it should be accessed** (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, etc).
- Kubernetes **will bind a matching PV** with the PVC.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Using PVC in a Pod (Claims As Volumes)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-using-pvc
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"  # Where the data will appear in container
          name: html-volume
  volumes:
    - name: html-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pvc-manual # The PVC we created earlier # This PVC must already exist
```

### üß† Breakdown:

| Section                                       | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `volumeMounts.mountPath`                      | Where the data will be stored inside the container                          |
| `volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName`     | Which PVC this Pod will use to mount storage                                |
| PVC                                           | Must exist and be bound to a suitable PV or use a dynamic StorageClass      |

This ensures data persists even if the Pod is restarted or rescheduled on a different node.

---

## ‚ö° 5. Dynamic Provisioning with [StorageClass](storage-class.md) (e.g., AWS EBS)

A `StorageClass` defines how storage should be provisioned dynamically. It provides a way to **dynamically provision PVs**. Defines how PVs are created on-demand.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Provisioner**: The component that creates the PV (e.g., AWS EBS, GCE PD, etc.).
- Tells Kubernetes what provisioner to use (e.g., AWS EBS, NFS, hostPath, etc).
- Defines **reclaim policies** (Delete, Retain, Recycle).
- Used by PVC to dynamically provision PV.

### PVC Using StorageClass

```yaml
# Create a StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc # Name of the storage class (usually dynamic provisioner)
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs  # Defines which external provisioner to use
parameters:
  type: gp2  # General purpose SSD
  fsType: ext4  # Filesystem type
reclaimPolicy: Delete  # Automatically delete volume when PVC is deleted
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer  # Delay volume binding until pod is scheduled
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: ebs-sc  # Links to the above StorageClass # This will trigger dynamic provisioning
```

---

## üìå 6. Pod Example Using Dynamic PVC

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bankapp-db
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bankapp-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: bankapp-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:15
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  # Default path for Postgres data # Inside container path
              name: db-volume # Must match volume name below
      volumes:
        - name: db-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: ebs-pvc # This PVC must already exist
```

### üîê Security & Best Practices

| Best Practice                              | Why It Matters                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ReadWriteOnce` for DBs                      | Prevent data corruption from multi-node write access                      |
| `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`  | Prevents PV creation until Pod is scheduled (optimizes storage location)  |
| `Retain` reclaim policy (for prod)           | Avoids accidental data loss                                              |
| Use `StorageClass` for dynamic volumes       | Scales with your app automatically                                         |

## üì° 7. `ReadWriteMany` Example with NFS

Sometimes, we underwent **a situation where multiple pods need to read and write to the same storage location concurrently**.

In Kubernetes:
- `ReadWriteOnce (RWO)` ‚Üí One pod can read/write.
- `ReadOnlyMany (ROX)` ‚Üí Many pods can read.
- `ReadWriteMany (RWX)` ‚Üí Many pods can read and write.

But most common cloud provisioners like EBS, GCE PD, etc., **don‚Äôt support RWX** ‚Äî so to achieve **shared read-write storage** for multiple pods, we often use **NFS (or other RWX-capable storage systems)**.

> Click [here](rwx-nfs-volume.md) to know **how to set up a Kubernetes volume with ReadWriteMany access using NFS** ‚Äî so multiple pods can mount the same volume concurrently and perform both read and write operations on it.

---

## üîó Relationship Between PV, PVC, and StorageClass

Here's how they work together:

### üì¶ Static Provisioning
- You **create a PersistentVolume (PV)** manually.
- Then a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** binds to it based on specs (e.g., size, access mode and storage class).
- ‚ùå **No StorageClass** is needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Provisioning *(Most Common in Production)*
- You **create a StorageClass** first.
- Then a **PVC** requests storage using that **StorageClass**.
- Kubernetes **automatically provisions a matching PV** for that PVC using the defined StorageClass.

---

## üìå AccessModes in Kubernetes are **Pod-level permissions** ‚Äî NOT Node-level

Here‚Äôs how they really work:

| Access Mode  | Meaning                                                 | Scope        |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) | **One Pod can mount it as read-write**. It may still be accessed from multiple nodes, but **only one pod at a time can have it mounted read-write**. | **Per Pod** |
| `ReadOnlyMany` (ROX) | **Many Pods can mount it read-only at the same time** ‚Äî across one or multiple nodes. | **Per Pod** |
| `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) | **Many Pods can mount it as read-write simultaneously** ‚Äî across multiple nodes. | **Per Pod** |

#### ‚úÖ So ‚Äî **the unit of access is always the pod.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Reclaim Policies (What happens after PVC is deleted?)

| Policy  | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retain  | Keep the PV data after PVC deletion. Manual cleanup needed.                |
| Delete  | Automatically delete the storage backend when PVC is deleted.              |
| Recycle | *(Deprecated)* Basic scrub + reuse. Not recommended anymore.               |

## ‚úÖ Visual Diagram: Integration Flow

```
User applies PVC
   ‚Üì
PVC references StorageClass (if dynamic)
   ‚Üì
StorageClass provisions PV (e.g., AWS EBS or NFS volume)
   ‚Üì
PVC gets bound to the new PV
   ‚Üì
Pod mounts PVC as a volume
```

## üîê Best Practices

| Area           | Recommendation                                                   |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reclaim Policy | Use `Retain` for critical apps (DBs), `Delete` for temp data     |
| Access Modes   | `ReadWriteOnce` for DBs, `ReadOnlyMany` for shared content       |
| StorageClass   | Use for dynamic provisioning with CSI drivers                    |
| Binding Mode   | Use `WaitForFirstConsumer` to improve pod scheduling             |
| Monitoring     | Watch PVC binding status: `kubectl get pvc`                      |
