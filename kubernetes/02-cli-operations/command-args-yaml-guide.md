# 🧠 Kubernetes: Mastering `command` and `args` in YAML Manifests

In Kubernetes, the `command` and `args` fields let you **override the default Docker ENTRYPOINT and CMD**, respectively. But due to different use cases, there are **multiple ways to write them**, each with subtle effects.

This guide explains **each variation**, with syntax, behavior, examples, and smart notes.

---

## 📌 Quick Mapping with Docker

| YAML Field  | Equivalent in Docker | Purpose                              |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `command`   | `ENTRYPOINT`         | Sets the main executable             |
| `args`      | `CMD`                | Sets default arguments for command   |

---

## ✨ Variation 1: `command` as full command

```yaml
command: ["sleep", "1000"]
```

- 🧠 This is equivalent to: `ENTRYPOINT ["sleep", "1000"]` in Docker.
- ✅ Everything is in `command`; `args` is omitted.
- ⏱️ Pod will sleep for 1000 seconds.

✅ **Works with:** array syntax (square brackets).

## ✨ Variation 2: Split `command` and `args`

```yaml
command: ["sleep"]
args: ["1000"]
```

- 🧠 This is equivalent to:  
  `ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]`  
  `CMD ["1000"]`
- 💡 More flexible if you want to override just `args` at runtime.
- ✅ Preferred way if you plan to reuse the image with different parameters.

## ✨ Variation 3: List Syntax without Brackets

```yaml
command:
  - sleep
  - "1000"
```

- ✅ Same as Variation 1, but using YAML's list format.
- 🔒 Note: Quotation `"1000"` ensures it's treated as a **string** (important if the value starts with zero or special characters).

## ✨ Variation 4: List Syntax with Split `args`

```yaml
command:
  - sleep
args:
  - "1000"
```

- 🔍 Functionally identical to Variation 2 but in long list format.
- ✅ Great for **readability**, especially for longer scripts or parameters.

---

## ✨ Variation 5: Inline Shell Script

```yaml
command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'this is ibtisam'; while true; do sleep 5; done"]
```

- 🧠 You’re invoking a shell (`sh`) and asking it to execute a full script as a string.
- 🔥 Everything must be combined in one string (like a one-liner).
- ⚠️ If using shell features like loops or env vars (`$VAR`), this is the go-to style.

## ✨ Variation 6: Split Shell and Script

```yaml
command: ["sh", "-c"]
args: ["echo 'this is ibtisam'; while true; do sleep 5; done"]
```

- ✅ More modular: `command` starts the shell, `args` passes the actual script.
- ♻️ Easier to change the script later without touching the shell config.

## ✨ Variation 7: Long List with Shell

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - echo 'this is ibtisam'; while true; do sleep 5; done
```

- 📚 Readable version of Variation 5.
- ⚠️ Remember: entire script is still one string — no need to break it down unless you’re using `|`.

## ✨ Variation 8: Split Command as List + Args

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
args:
  - echo 'this is ibtisam'; while true; do sleep 5; done
```

- 🧩 `command` is split into individual list items (`sh`, `-c`) for clarity.
- 🧵 `args` holds the actual shell script, making script updates isolated and cleaner.
- 🛠️ Useful when automating or templating values — you can inject logic into `args` without touching the entrypoint logic.
- 🧠 Functionally identical to Variation 6, but more YAML-native and readable.

## ✨ Variation 9: Using `&&` to chain commands

```yaml
command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo $USER && echo $PWD']
```

- 🧠 `&&` ensures that the second command runs only if the first succeeds.
- 💡 Use `;` instead if you want both commands to run **regardless** of success/failure.

✅ **Good for:** chaining commands with environment variables or multiple steps.

## ❌ Common Pitfall: Multiple strings inside one shell `-c`

```yaml
# ❌ Incorrect
command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo $PWD', 'sleep 3600']
```

- ⚠️ Only the **first string** after `-c` will be treated as script.
- ✅ Fix: Combine all into **one string** using `&&`, `;`, or multiline string (`|`).

## ✨ Variation 10: Using Multi-line Script (`|`)

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - |
    echo $PWD
    ls -l /etc/os-release
    cat /etc/os-release
    sleep 3600 && echo $USER
```

- 📜 YAML’s `|` turns the following indented lines into **one string**.
- ✅ Cleaner for long scripts.
- 💡 Perfect for readability and when commands span multiple lines.

---

## 🔍 Special Notes

- **Prefer double quotes (`"`)** when:
  - Using environment variables (`$USER`, `$PWD`).
  - Including strings with special characters.
  
- **`sh -c` is your friend** when:
  - Writing conditional logic, loops, chaining commands, etc.
  
- **Use `args` only when `command` is simple** — like launching a binary or script.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Kubernetes gives you a lot of flexibility in how you write `command` and `args`. The best practice depends on:

- **Your use case** (simple command vs shell scripting).
- **Need for readability** (use multiline `|` when scripts grow).
- **Clarity** (split `command` and `args` for modularity).

### What you wrote:

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - echo '$ABC' && sleep 3600
```

Here, `'$ABC'` is wrapped in **single quotes** → that means the shell will literally print **`$ABC`**, not the value of the environment variable.

---

### ✅ Correct way:

You should **not** quote with single quotes. Use either no quotes or double quotes so that `$ABC` gets expanded:

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - echo $ABC && sleep 3600
```

or:

```yaml
command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - "echo $ABC && sleep 3600"
```

Both will properly expand the environment variable `ABC`.
