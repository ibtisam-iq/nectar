### ðŸš¨ Why the Mismatch?

This means that the **ReplicaSet was updated** at some point (image changed to `busybox`), **but the old pods were not terminated**, so theyâ€™re still running with `busybox777`.

In Kubernetes:

* A ReplicaSet does **not update existing pods** when its template is changed.
* It will only apply the new template to **new pods** (if old ones are deleted).

---

### âœ… How to Fix

To apply the updated image (`busybox`) to all pods:

#### Delete the old pods manually

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l name=busybox-pod
```

This will trigger the ReplicaSet to:

* Create new pods
* Using the latest template (with `busybox`)
