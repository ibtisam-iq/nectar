# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

## üöÄ Use Case: Scalable Web App with Autoscaling

Imagine you're running a **Node.js web application** inside Kubernetes:

* CPU-intensive under load
* Memory is stable
* Needs fast **scale-up** to handle spikes
* Needs **slow scale-down** to avoid flapping

We'll build this scenario around the structure you posted.

---

## üß† Section-by-Section Deep Dive

---

### üîó `scaleTargetRef`

```yaml
scaleTargetRef:
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  name: webapp-deployment
```

* **What this does**: Points to the **workload to autoscale**.
* This must be a **scalable resource**, like a `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, or `StatefulSet`.

---

### üìà `metrics`

Defines **what to measure** in order to decide when to scale.

There are 6 types supported:

#### 1. `resource` (Common: CPU or Memory)

```yaml
metrics:
- type: Resource
  resource:
    name: cpu
    target:
      type: Utilization
      averageUtilization: 70
```

* **Use-case**: Scale when **average CPU usage** across pods exceeds 70%
* Kubernetes gets this from the **metrics-server**

‚úÖ Simple and effective for most workloads

---

#### 2. `containerResource`

```yaml
- type: ContainerResource
  container: app
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: Utilization
    averageUtilization: 80
```

* **Use-case**: Scale based on **container-specific** resource usage.
* Useful when a pod runs **multiple containers**, and you only care about one.

---

#### 3. `external`

```yaml
- type: External
  external:
    metric:
      name: queue_length
    target:
      type: AverageValue
      averageValue: "10"
```

* **Use-case**: Scale based on **external systems**, like:

  * Cloud Pub/Sub queue length
  * Kafka lag
  * AWS SQS messages

You need a **custom metrics adapter** (e.g. Prometheus Adapter) to use this.

---

#### 4. `object`

```yaml
- type: Object
  object:
    describedObject:
      kind: Service
      name: my-service
      apiVersion: v1
    metric:
      name: request_rate
    target:
      type: Value
      value: "100"
```

* **Use-case**: Scale based on a metric **associated with a specific Kubernetes object**, like a Service or Ingress.

---

#### 5. `pods`

```yaml
- type: Pods
  pods:
    metric:
      name: http_requests_per_second
    target:
      type: AverageValue
      averageValue: "100"
```

* **Use-case**: Scale based on **per-pod metrics** like request count, queue depth, etc.
* You‚Äôll use this with **custom metrics**.

---

#### 6. `type`

Each metric block must define its `type`: one of:

* `Resource`
* `Pods`
* `Object`
* `External`
* `ContainerResource`

---

### üìà `minReplicas` / `maxReplicas`

```yaml
minReplicas: 2
maxReplicas: 10
```

* **Guarantees** that the deployment has at least 2 and no more than 10 pods.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `behavior` (v2 feature ‚Äì advanced scaling control)

This is **new in v2**, allowing you to fine-tune scaling velocity & strategy.

```yaml
behavior:
  scaleUp:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 15
    selectPolicy: Max
    policies:
    - type: Percent
      value: 100
      periodSeconds: 15
  scaleDown:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
    selectPolicy: Min
    policies:
    - type: Pods
      value: 1
      periodSeconds: 60
```

#### üü¢ `scaleUp`:

* **stabilizationWindowSeconds**: Prevents **too rapid scale-up**

  * Only uses metrics from last 15s
* **policies**: How fast to scale:

  * `type: Percent` ‚Üí double the pods (100%)
  * `type: Pods` ‚Üí increase by a fixed number
* **selectPolicy**: Choose which policy applies if multiple match

  * `Max`: use the one that scales fastest
  * `Min`: use the slowest
  * `Disabled`: ignore policy (rare)

#### üî¥ `scaleDown`:

* Same structure as `scaleUp`, but usually more **conservative** to avoid flapping.
* `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60` means only metrics **older than 60s** will be considered.

## üìä Summary Table

| Field                         | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `scaleTargetRef`              | Which workload to autoscale                 |
| `minReplicas` / `maxReplicas` | Replication limits                          |
| `metrics`                     | What to watch (CPU, memory, external, etc.) |
| `behavior`                    | How aggressively to scale                   |
| `scaleUp / scaleDown`         | Fine control over scaling speed & windows   |

---

## üìÇ Overall Purpose of `behavior`

The `behavior` section gives you **precise control over how fast and how often the HPA scales your pods**.

### Why it exists:

* Older HPA (v1) would just react to metrics every 15s without much intelligence ‚Äî this could lead to **flapping** (scale up, scale down rapidly).
* With `behavior`, you can control:

  * How aggressively to **scale up** (faster response to load)
  * How conservatively to **scale down** (avoid instability)

---

## üü¢ `scaleUp` Section

```yaml
scaleUp:
  stabilizationWindowSeconds: 15
  selectPolicy: Max
  policies:
  - type: Percent
    value: 100
    periodSeconds: 15
```

### üîπ `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 15`

* This tells Kubernetes:

  > "When deciding to scale **up**, only consider the **most recent decision** made in the last 15 seconds."

üìå **Real-world**: This prevents wild fluctuations due to temporary spikes in CPU or custom metrics.

üí° *Example*: If at 12:00:00, the autoscaler sees CPU > 70% and decides to go from 2 ‚Üí 4 pods, and then at 12:00:10 it again sees high CPU, it won‚Äôt immediately try 4 ‚Üí 8 until 15 seconds are up.

---

### üîπ `selectPolicy: Max`

* If multiple `policies` are defined, this tells HPA to:

  > "Choose the policy that allows the **most pods to be added**."

üß† **Other values** could be:

* `Min`: scale by the smallest allowed number
* `Disabled`: disables automatic scaling (rare)

---

### üîπ `policies` (for `scaleUp`)

```yaml
- type: Percent
  value: 100
  periodSeconds: 15
```

This means:

> "In any **15-second** window, the number of pods can be increased by **up to 100%**."

‚úÖ **Examples**:

| Current Pods | Max Scale Up (100%) | New Max Pods |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 2            | 2                   | 4            |
| 4            | 4                   | 8            |

So, if HPA wants to scale from 2 to 8 ‚Äî it won‚Äôt do it all at once.

* It will only scale from 2 ‚Üí 4 (within 15s)
* Then 4 ‚Üí 8 in the **next** 15s, if the high load continues.

---

## üîª `scaleDown` Section

```yaml
scaleDown:
  stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
  selectPolicy: Min
  policies:
  - type: Pods
    value: 1
    periodSeconds: 60
```

### üîπ `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60`

* HPA will only scale **down** if the metric (e.g., CPU) has been **below target** for the last 60 seconds **consistently**.
* Prevents scaling down too soon after a short dip.

üìå *Reason*: Scaling down too fast can hurt performance if load suddenly comes back (called ‚Äúthrashing‚Äù).

---

### üîπ `selectPolicy: Min`

> "Choose the **most conservative** (smallest) action from all matching policies."

* In this case, we only have one policy: reduce 1 pod.

---

### üîπ `policies` (for `scaleDown`)

```yaml
- type: Pods
  value: 1
  periodSeconds: 60
```

This means:

> "In every 60-second window, only **1 pod** can be removed."

‚úÖ **Examples**:

| Current Pods | Max Scale Down | New Pods |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------- |
| 10           | -1             | 9        |
| 5            | -1             | 4        |

This gives your app time to stabilize and ensures you don‚Äôt downscale too aggressively.

| 01:00 | 30%   | 8    | Still not scaled down yet (60s window not passed) |
| 01:30 | 25%   | 8    | Downscale to 7                                    |
| 02:30 | 20%   | 7    | Downscale to 6                                    |

## üß† Why You‚Äôd Use This Config

**Your goals might be:**

* Scale up **fast** when user traffic increases
* Avoid **aggressive scale-down**, so you don‚Äôt kill pods too soon and disrupt users
* Have complete **governance** over autoscaling behavior
