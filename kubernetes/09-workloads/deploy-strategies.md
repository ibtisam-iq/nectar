Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è exactly ‚Äî both **Blue-Green** and **Canary** are **deployment strategies**.

üëâ Their purpose is the same: **release a new version of an application safely in Kubernetes (or any system) without downtime**.
üëâ The difference lies in **how traffic is shifted** from the old version to the new version:

* **Blue-Green Deployment** ‚Üí switch is **all at once** (100% ‚Üí new version).
* **Canary Deployment** ‚Üí switch is **gradual** (e.g., 5%, 10%, 50%, 100%).

They‚Äôre both valid strategies, and teams usually choose based on:

* **Risk tolerance** (instant cutover vs slow rollout).
* **Resources available** (Blue-Green is more costly).
* **Business need** (fast rollback vs safe testing).

‚ö° So yes, both are **deployment strategies** under the broader umbrella of **Continuous Delivery / Release Management**.

## üìå Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

* **Concept**:

  * Maintain **two environments**:

    * **Blue** ‚Üí current live version.
    * **Green** ‚Üí new version (standby).
  * Only one of them receives production traffic at a time.
* **Traffic Switching**:

  * Achieved using **labels + selectors** in Kubernetes.
  * **Service** routes traffic to Pods based on labels.
  * During switch: update the Service‚Äôs **selector label** from Blue ‚Üí Green.
* **Rollback**:

  * Simply re-point Service back to the old label.
  * No pod termination/re-creation needed, traffic switch is instant.

### Example YAML (Blue-Green with Labels)

```yaml
# --------------------------
# Service (entry point)
# --------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp       # Constant app name
    version: blue    # üëà Service currently pointing to "blue" version
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
# --------------------------
# Blue Deployment
# --------------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: blue   # üëà Label matches Service selector
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:v1   # Old version
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
# --------------------------
# Green Deployment
# --------------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: green   # üëà Label for new version
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:v2   # New version
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

## ‚ö° Switching Traffic (Blue ‚Üí Green)

* Initially:

  ```yaml
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: blue   # Traffic goes to Blue pods
  ```

* After switch:

  ```yaml
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: green  # üëà Change here ‚Üí traffic now goes to Green pods
  ```

* Rollback: just change `green` back to `blue`.

---

## üìå Canary Deployment Strategy

* **Concept**:

  * Deploy a **small subset of pods** with the new version (canary).
  * Run them **alongside the stable version** (main).
  * Service points to **both** using common labels ‚Üí traffic is split between stable & canary.
  * Increase canary replicas gradually until stable version is fully replaced.
* **Traffic Control**:

  * **Labels + replica count** control distribution.
  * Example: 90% traffic to stable (9 pods), 10% to canary (1 pod).
  * Advanced routing (e.g., Istio/NGINX) can provide percentage-based splits.

### Example YAML (Canary with Labels)

```yaml
# --------------------------
# Service (entry point)
# --------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp   # üëà Service only looks at "app: myapp"
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
# --------------------------
# Stable Deployment
# --------------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-stable
spec:
  replicas: 9       # üëà 90% of traffic (9 pods)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: stable
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: stable
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:v1   # Stable version
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
# --------------------------
# Canary Deployment
# --------------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1       # üëà 10% of traffic (1 pod)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: canary
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:v2   # New version (canary)
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

## ‚ö° How Traffic Splitting Works

* Service selects pods by **`app: myapp`** (ignores version).
* Both stable (`version: stable`) and canary (`version: canary`) pods match ‚Üí Service sends traffic to both.
* Traffic ratio depends on **replica count**:

  * 9 stable pods ‚Üí ~90% traffic.
  * 1 canary pod ‚Üí ~10% traffic.

## Canary Progression

1. Start with **small replica count** for canary (e.g., 1 pod).
2. Monitor metrics, logs, errors.
3. Gradually increase canary replicas ‚Üí shift more traffic.
4. Once stable, **scale down stable to 0** and run only canary.

### üìä Blue-Green vs Canary Deployment (Detailed Difference)

| Aspect              | **Blue-Green Deployment**                                                                                                                          | **Canary Deployment**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Idea**       | Maintain two identical environments: **Blue (current)** and **Green (new)**. Switch all traffic at once by changing labels.                        | Deploy **small subset (canary)** of new version alongside stable version. Gradually shift traffic.                                                                                                                          |
| **Labels Usage**    | - Service selector uses `app: myapp` + `version: blue/green`. <br> - Switching = **change Service label selector** from `blue ‚Üí green`.            | - Service selector uses only common label `app: myapp`. <br> - Both stable & canary pods share `app: myapp` but differ in `version: stable/canary`. <br> - Traffic split is controlled by **replica count** (or advanced routing tools). |
| **Traffic Shift**   | **Instant & complete**: 100% traffic moves to new version once Service label changes.                                                              | **Gradual**: Percentage of traffic flows to canary based on replicas (e.g., 9 stable + 1 canary = ~90/10 split).                                                                                                            |
| **Rollback**        | Very fast ‚Üí simply change Service selector back to old label.                                                                                      | Requires scaling down/removing canary and keeping stable pods, or adjusting replicas.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Risk Level**      | Higher risk ‚ö†Ô∏è (since all traffic moves instantly to new version).                                                                                 | Lower risk ‚úÖ (small % of traffic exposed first, issues detected early).                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Resource Usage**  | Requires **two full environments** (Blue + Green), doubling resource cost during rollout.                                                          | Only a few canary pods in addition to stable pods ‚Üí **less resource heavy**.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Use Case**        | - When you need **zero downtime cutover**. <br> - When infra cost is not a concern. <br> - When rollback speed is critical.                        | - When you want to **test new version with real traffic gradually**. <br> - When you need safer rollouts and monitoring-based progression.                                                                                  |
| **YAML Difference** | - Service points to `version: blue` or `version: green`. <br> - Example: <br> `yaml selector: {app: myapp, version: blue} ` ‚Üí switched to `green`. | - Service points only to common label`app: myapp`. <br> - Example: <br> `yaml selector: {app: myapp} ` <br> Both `stable` and `canary` pods match, traffic splits automatically.                                                        |

### üîë Summary

* **Blue-Green** = **fast switch, high risk**, needs **Service label change** (`blue ‚Üî green`).
* **Canary** = **gradual rollout, safer**, needs **replica adjustments** (stable vs canary pods).
