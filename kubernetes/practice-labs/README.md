# 📘 CKA & CKAD Practice Labs

A hands-on **open lab of Kubernetes practice questions and solutions**, curated during my preparation for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** and **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exams. This repository is designed to help every Kubernetes learner succeed.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

The core purpose is **to serve the community**. Preparing for CKA/CKAD involves solving tricky, exam-like scenarios under time pressure. I created this lab to share **real questions, outputs, and explanations**, reducing the struggle for future candidates.

💡 *If you sincerely practice these questions and understand the explanations, you’ll be well-prepared to pass the exams.*

## 🔑 How I Prepared

I prepared for **CKA and CKAD in parallel**, using:

* **KodeKloud** courses and labs
* **KillerCoda** scenarios
* **Killer.sh** (official simulator)
* **Udemy** practice material
* **YouTube** tutorials
* **ChatGPT** (for concept breakdowns and alternate perspectives)

For simple tasks, I practiced without recording. For complex tasks, I documented:

* The **original question statement**
* **Shell commands & outputs**
* **AI-Assisted Troubleshooting & Explanations** (with exam tips and gotchas)
