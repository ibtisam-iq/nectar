# Kubernetes Cluster Setup Guide

## Overview of Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originating from Google's internal system Borg, Kubernetes was open-sourced in 2014 and has since become the de facto standard for container orchestration. It provides a robust framework for managing microservices-based architectures, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience in modern cloud-native environments.

### Core Concepts

At its core, Kubernetes operates on a cluster-based [architecture](architecture.md) comprising a control plane and worker nodes. The control plane manages the cluster's state, while nodes run the containerized workloads. Key [objects](objects.md) include Pods, the smallest deployable units that encapsulate containers; Deployments, which manage stateless applications; and StatefulSets, for stateful workloads. Kubernetes leverages a [declarative API](declarative-api-process.md), allowing users to define desired states in [YAML](https://github.com/ibtisam-iq/nectar/tree/main/yaml) or JSON manifests, which the system continuously reconciles.

### Cluster Setup and Configuration

[Setting up a Kubernetes](./cluster-setup/README.md) cluster involves configuring the control plane components (API server, controller manager, scheduler) and ensuring nodes are properly networked. [Configuration Maps](configmap-guide.md) and [Secrets](secret-guide.md) enable dynamic configuration and secure management of sensitive data. [Resource quotas](resource-quota-guide.md) and [limit ranges](limit-range-guide.md) are critical for [enforcing resource boundaries](limitrange-resourcequota-together.md), ensuring fair usage across [namespaces](limitrange-resourcequota-demo.md) and preventing resource starvation.

### Workload Management

Kubernetes excels in managing diverse workloads. [Jobs](jobs-guide.md) and [CronJobs](cron-job-guide.md) handle batch processing and scheduled tasks, while Deployments and ReplicaSets ensure desired replica counts for stateless applications. For stateful applications, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) provide stable storage, with StorageClasses defining provisioning rules. Concepts like [fsGroup](fsGroup.md) ensure proper file system permissions within Pods.

### Networking and Ingress

Networking in Kubernetes is facilitated by a flat network model, where Pods communicate via ClusterIP services. Ingress resources manage external traffic, providing load balancing, SSL termination, and path-based routing. Network Policies enforce fine-grained access control, securing communication between Pods. Understanding Ingress controllers and their configurations is key to exposing services efficiently.

### Security Practices

Security in Kubernetes is multi-layered. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) governs user and workload permissions, while Security Contexts define Pod-level security settings, such as running containers as non-root. Secrets manage sensitive data like API keys, and Pod Security Policies (deprecated in favor of admission controllers) enforce security standards. Taints and tolerations further isolate workloads, ensuring critical applications run on designated nodes.

### Scaling and Resource Management

Kubernetes supports both horizontal and vertical scaling. Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) adjust replica counts based on metrics like CPU usage, while Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPAs) tune resource requests and limits. Resource quotas and limit ranges complement scaling by enforcing constraints, ensuring efficient resource utilization across the cluster.

### Debugging and Monitoring

Effective debugging in Kubernetes involves analyzing logs, events, and Pod states. Kubectl provides powerful commands for inspecting cluster resources, while probes (liveness, readiness, and startup) ensure Pods are healthy. Best practices include setting up monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana, alongside logging solutions like Fluentd or Elasticsearch, to gain visibility into cluster performance.

### Advanced Features

Advanced Kubernetes features include taints and tolerations for node affinity, ensuring workloads run on suitable nodes. Affinity and anti-affinity rules further refine scheduling, enabling colocation or separation of Pods based on labels. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators extend Kubernetes functionality, allowing for the management of complex applications like databases.

### Quick References and Cheatsheets

For practitioners, quick references and cheatsheets are invaluable. They provide concise commands for common tasks, such as scaling deployments, inspecting Pods, or managing services. A well-structured cheatsheet can accelerate troubleshooting and streamline cluster operations.
