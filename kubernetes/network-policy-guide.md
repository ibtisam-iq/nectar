# üó≠Ô∏è Kubernetes NetworkPolicy: Full Guide

## üìå What is NetworkPolicy?

`NetworkPolicy` is a **Kubernetes object** that controls **network traffic** between **pods**, and between **pods and other network endpoints**. It acts like a **firewall** for pod-to-pod communication.

> üß† Think of it as security guards controlling who can enter or leave a building (pod). Without it, anyone can come and go freely.

---

## ‚ùå Default Behavior

By **default**, if no `NetworkPolicy` is defined:
- All pods can **talk to all other pods**.
- Any external IP can **reach any pod**.

But once a `NetworkPolicy` is applied to a pod:
- The pod becomes **isolated**.
- Only allowed traffic defined by the policy is permitted.

## üìÄ NetworkPolicy Structure

Here‚Äôs a **full example** with all major fields and detailed comments.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-access
  namespace: bankapp  # üîπ The namespace where this policy is applied

spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db  # üåü Target only pods with label 'role=db'

  policyTypes:
    - Ingress   # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Controls incoming traffic to the selected pods
    - Egress    # ‚û°Ô∏è Controls outgoing traffic from the selected pods

  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: api  # ‚úÖ Only allow pods with label 'role=api' to access
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              team: frontend  # ‚úÖ Allow any pod from namespace with label team=frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432  # ‚úÖ Allow access only on PostgreSQL port (5432)

  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24  # ‚úÖ Allow outgoing traffic to internal network
            except:
              - 10.0.0.5/32    # ‚ùå Block this specific IP
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53             # ‚úÖ Allow DNS resolution (TCP DNS)
```

## üîç Field-by-Field Breakdown

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `podSelector` | Defines which pods this policy applies to. |
| `policyTypes` | Can be `Ingress`, `Egress`, or both. |
| `ingress` | Controls which sources can send traffic *to* the selected pods. |
| `egress` | Controls which destinations selected pods can send traffic *to*. |
| `namespaceSelector` | Controls access based on namespace labels. |
| `ipBlock` | Allows you to whitelist or blacklist IP ranges. |
| `ports` | Limits communication to specific ports and protocols. |

## üéØ Real World Case Study

**Use Case: BankApp Security**

Your banking backend (`role=db`) should:
- Only be accessible by `role=api` pods.
- Not communicate to any IP outside your internal network except DNS.

You apply this policy:
- API pods can talk to DB pods.
- DB pods can only go out to 10.0.0.0/24, but not 10.0.0.5.
- No one else can talk to DB pods.

## üìå Additional Examples

### Example 1: Allow traffic only from same namespace
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector: {}
```

### Example 2: Deny all ingress traffic (isolate pod)
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress: []  # Deny all incoming
```

### Example 3: Allow egress only to specific DNS IP
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress-dns
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 8.8.8.8/32  # Google DNS
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
```

## üìÇ Create YAML Imperatively?

No built-in `kubectl create networkpolicy` command. You must:

```bash
kubectl create -f network-policy.yaml
```
