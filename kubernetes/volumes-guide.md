# Kubernetes Volumes: Deep Dive into PV, PVC, StorageClass

This documentation provides a production-grade understanding of Kubernetes storage management using Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and Storage Classes.

---

## üì¶ 1. PersistentVolume (PV)

A **PersistentVolume (PV)** is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically by Kubernetes using a **StorageClass**. It‚Äôs a cluster-wide resource.

### Key Characteristics:

- Cluster-scoped object (not namespace-bound).
- Has details about **capacity, access modes, storage backend**, etc.
- Can be **manually created** (Static) or created on demand via **StorageClass** (Dynamic).

### üîç Is `storageClassName` required in a PV?
- **Static provisioning**: Recommended to include it and match the PVC's `storageClassName`.
- **Manual binding (no dynamic provisioning)**: Set to `""` (empty string) to prevent Kubernetes from dynamic provisioning.
- **Dynamic provisioning**: You even do **not** create the PV. Kubernetes auto-creates it using the `StorageClass`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: HostPath (for local testing only; static provisioning)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-manual
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi  # Total size of the volume
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Can be mounted as read-write by a single node
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  # Keeps the volume data after PVC is deleted
  storageClassName: manual  # Matches with PVC's storageClassName
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"  # Simulated path on the node; not used in production (used only for local testing)
    type: DirectoryOrCreate  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
```
- For production environments, use a **StorageClass** to dynamically provision PVs.
- `hostPath` is not suitable for production environments as it relies on the node's file system.
- `Retain` reclaim policy is used here for demonstration purposes; in production, use `Delete` or `Recycle` reclaim policies.
- `ReadWriteOnce` access mode is used here for demonstration purposes; in production, use `ReadWriteMany` or `ReadOnlyMany` access modes.
- `10Gi` capacity is used here for demonstration purposes; in production, use a suitable capacity value.
> üî• **Note:** In production, this might use `awsElasticBlockStore`, `nfs`, or `csi drivers` instead of hostPath.

### ‚úÖ Example: AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) (static provisioning)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-ebs
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: aws-ebs
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: vol-0123456789abcdef0  # Pre-created EBS volume ID
    fsType: ext4
```

## üìò TL;DR:

| Property                | Value                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Volume source           | Manually provided (`awsElasticBlockStore` with a fixed volume ID) |
| storageClassName role  | Tag to match with PVC                    |
| Who provisions the volume? | **You** (manually in AWS or on local node)  |
| Provisioning type       | ‚úÖ **Static provisioning**                    |

### ‚úÖ Example: NFS (ReadWriteMany)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-nfs
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 50Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # Can be mounted as RW by multiple nodes
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: nfs
  nfs:
    path: /exported/path # points to the exported path of the NFS server, which is already set up manually.
    server: nfs-server.example.com # indicates a static NFS server, which is managed outside Kubernetes.
```
> **Note:** The **entire PV** is defined by the user, meaning **you're manually provisioning the volume**. Kubernetes isn't responsible for creating this storage; you're simply informing Kubernetes to use the specified NFS server.

### ‚úÖ Example: CSI Volume (Generic CSI Plugin)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-csi
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: csi-sc
  csi:
    driver: ebs.csi.aws.com  # CSI driver name
    volumeHandle: vol-0abcd1234cdef5678  # Unique volume ID
    fsType: ext4
```
### Why It's Static Provisioning:

- **Manual EBS Volume Reference**: The `csi.volumeHandle` points to a pre-existing EBS volume (e.g., `vol-0abcd1234cdef5678`). This volume is manually created in AWS.

- **CSI Driver Reference**: The use of `csi.driver` (`ebs.csi.aws.com`) points to the CSI driver, but the volume itself is already provisioned by the user, not dynamically by Kubernetes.

- **User-Defined PV**: You're telling Kubernetes to use an already-created EBS volume, meaning you're manually provisioning the volume.

- **storageClassName**: The presence of the `storageClassName` (e.g., `csi-sc`) is still useful for matching the PVC, but it doesn't trigger dynamic provisioning here.

## üö¶ How to Know Whether a PV is Static or Dynamic?

| Clue | Static Provisioning | Dynamic Provisioning |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| PV Manifest Exists | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| PVC references a known `storageClassName` | ‚úÖ Optional | ‚úÖ Required |
| PV has `storageClassName` matching PVC | ‚úÖ Yes | üö´ Auto-filled |
| PVC triggers StorageClass provisioning | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| PV created manually by admin | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

### ‚ùó Key Hint
> If you **manually write a PV**, it‚Äôs static provisioning. If you only write a PVC and `StorageClass` handles volume creation, it‚Äôs dynamic.

---

## üìÑ 2. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user. It specifies size, access modes, and storage class. The **developer** or **app owner**, usually within a namespace, creates a PVC.

### Key Characteristics:

- Namespace-scoped object.
- Describes **how much space** is needed and **how it should be accessed** (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, etc).
- Kubernetes **will bind a matching PV** with the PVC.

### Key Fields in PVC YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-manual
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Can be mounted on one node # Matches the PV
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi  # Requested size # Must be <= available PV
  storageClassName: manual  # Matches the PV or StorageClass
# storageClassName: aws-ebs
# storageClassName: nfs
# storageClassName: csi-sc

```
- The value of `storageClassName` is not fixed; it can be any name, but it **must match** the name of the `StorageClass` or the value in the PV and PVC manifest for proper binding.
- üîÑ This PVC will only bind to a PV that also has `storageClassName: manual`.
> üìå PVC binds to a suitable PV if `accessModes`, `storageClassName`, and `requests.storage` match.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Using PVC in a Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-using-pvc
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"  # Where the data will appear in container
          name: html-volume
  volumes:
    - name: html-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pvc-manual # The PVC we created earlier # This PVC must already exist
```

### üß† Breakdown:

| Section                                       | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `volumeMounts.mountPath`                      | Where the data will be stored inside the container                          |
| `volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName`     | Which PVC this Pod will use to mount storage                                |
| PVC                                           | Must exist and be bound to a suitable PV or use a dynamic StorageClass      |

This ensures data persists even if the Pod is restarted or rescheduled on a different node.

## ‚ö° 4. Dynamic Provisioning with StorageClass (e.g., AWS EBS)

A StorageClass defines how storage should be provisioned dynamically. It provides a way to **dynamically provision PVs**. Defines how PVs are created on-demand.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Provisioner**: The component that creates the PV (e.g., AWS EBS, GCE PD, etc.).
- Tells Kubernetes what provisioner to use (e.g., AWS EBS, NFS, hostPath, etc).
- Defines **reclaim policies** (Delete, Retain, Recycle).
- Used by PVC to dynamically provision PV.

### StorageClass Example for AWS EBS

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc # Name of the storage class (usually dynamic provisioner)
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs  # Defines which external provisioner to use
parameters:
  type: gp2  # General purpose SSD
  fsType: ext4  # Filesystem type
reclaimPolicy: Delete  # Automatically delete volume when PVC is deleted
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer  # Delay volume binding until pod is scheduled
```

### StorageClass Example for NFS
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: nfs
provisioner: nfs.csi.k8s.io
parameters:
  server: nfs-server.example.com
  share: /exported/path
mountOptions:
  - vers=4.1
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

### StorageClass Example for CSI (EBS CSI Driver)
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: csi-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp2
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

### PVC Using StorageClass

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: ebs-sc  # Links to the above StorageClass # This will trigger dynamic provisioning
```
> **Note**: The StorageClass must be created before the PVC. The PVC will then use the StorageClass to dynamically provision a PV.
> ‚è≥ As soon as this PVC is applied, Kubernetes will **automatically provision an EBS volume**, create a matching PV, and bind it to this PVC.
---

## üìå 5. Pod Example Using Dynamic PVC

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bankapp-db
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bankapp-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: bankapp-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:15
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  # Default path for Postgres data # Inside container path
              name: db-volume # Must match volume name below
      volumes:
        - name: db-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: ebs-pvc # This PVC must already exist
```

### üîê Security & Best Practices

| Best Practice                              | Why It Matters                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ReadWriteOnce` for DBs                      | Prevent data corruption from multi-node write access                      |
| `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`  | Prevents PV creation until Pod is scheduled (optimizes storage location)  |
| `Retain` reclaim policy (for prod)           | Avoids accidental data loss                                              |
| Use `StorageClass` for dynamic volumes       | Scales with your app automatically                                         |

## üì° 6. ReadWriteMany Example with NFS

To enable shared access by multiple pods, we use **ReadWriteMany** with an NFS server:

### StorageClass for NFS

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: nfs-sc
provisioner: example.com/nfs  # Replace with your NFS CSI driver name
parameters:
  archiveOnDelete: "false"  # Optional behavior
```

### PVC Requesting RWX Access

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # RWX access
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: nfs-sc
```

### Pod Using Shared Volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: frontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: shared-storage
  volumes:
    - name: shared-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: shared-pvc
```

---

## üîó Relationship Between PV, PVC, and StorageClass

Here's how they work together:

### üì¶ Static Provisioning
- You **create a PersistentVolume (PV)** manually.
- Then a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** binds to it based on specs (e.g., size, access mode).
- ‚ùå **No StorageClass** is needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Provisioning *(Most Common in Production)*
- You **create a StorageClass** first.
- Then a **PVC** requests storage using that **StorageClass**.
- Kubernetes **automatically provisions a matching PV** for that PVC using the defined StorageClass.

## üîê Access Modes (Important in Multi-pod Usage)

| Mode            | Meaning                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ReadWriteOnce   | One node can mount read/write (most common)           |
| ReadOnlyMany    | Multiple nodes can mount read-only                    |
| ReadWriteMany   | Multiple nodes can mount read/write (less common, needs special backend) |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Reclaim Policies (What happens after PVC is deleted?)

| Policy  | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retain  | Keep the PV data after PVC deletion. Manual cleanup needed.                |
| Delete  | Automatically delete the storage backend when PVC is deleted.              |
| Recycle | *(Deprecated)* Basic scrub + reuse. Not recommended anymore.               |
