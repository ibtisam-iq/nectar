# Kubernetes Jobs: Deep Dive into `.spec` Configuration

## üß† Overview
A **Kubernetes Job** ensures that a **task runs to completion**. Unlike Deployments (which keep pods running), Jobs run **one-off or batch tasks** and terminate successfully once a desired number of pods complete successfully. In this guide, we will explore the `.spec` field of a Job in **intellectual depth**, breaking down each possible option, use case, and real-world scenario.

---

## üìå Basic Job Anatomy
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

---

## üîç 1. `spec.template`

The `template` field is **required** and defines the **Pod template** that Kubernetes will use to spawn pods for the Job. It follows the exact structure as a regular Pod definition.

### Key Requirements:
- Must have a valid container spec
- Must set `restartPolicy` to either:
  - `Never` (recommended): Let Kubernetes handle failures by creating new Pods.
  - `OnFailure`: Container restarts within the same Pod.
  - ‚ùå `Always` is **not allowed** in Jobs.

### Example:
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: task
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

---

## üîÅ 2. `spec.backoffLimit`

Controls how many times a Pod can **fail** before the Job is marked as **Failed**.

### Default:
```yaml
backoffLimit: 6
```

### Example Use Case:
```yaml
backoffLimit: 2
```
Try the pod 2 times. If both fail, mark the Job as failed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. `spec.parallelism`

Defines how many Pods can **run concurrently** at any moment.

### Values:
- Default: `1`
- `0`: Job is **paused**

### Example:
```yaml
parallelism: 3
```
Run 3 Pods simultaneously until the required number of completions is reached.

### Use Case Scenarios:
- **Parallel downloads** from a list
- **Batch processing** large datasets

---

## üéØ 4. `spec.completions`

The total number of **successful Pods** required to consider the Job **complete**.

### Example:
```yaml
completions: 5
```
Job finishes when **5 pods** succeed.

### Behavior Based on Parallelism:
If `parallelism: 2`, two Pods run simultaneously until 5 completions are reached.

### Default:
- If **unset**, defaults to `1`.

### Use Cases:
- Running 5 independent data extraction tasks

---

## üß† Job Execution Patterns

### 1. Non-parallel (Default):
```yaml
# completions and parallelism are both unset
defaults to:
completions: 1
parallelism: 1
```
Only one Pod runs and completes.

---

### 2. Fixed Completion Count:
```yaml
completions: 6
parallelism: 3
```
Run 3 Pods at once. Finish when 6 Pods succeed.

---

### 3. Work Queue Style:
```yaml
parallelism: 4
# completions is unset
```
- Each Pod **pulls work from a queue** (Redis, Kafka, etc.)
- Once **any Pod** succeeds and **all have exited**, the Job is done

---

## ‚èπÔ∏è 5. `spec.suspend`

Temporarily pause the Job.

```yaml
suspend: true
```
- Active Pods are deleted
- No new Pods are created

### Use Cases:
- CI/CD pipelines that trigger Jobs, but wait for approval
- Queued tasks held until external validation

---

## üß≤ 6. `spec.selector`

Defines the label selector for the pods **owned** by this Job.

### Example:
```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    job-name: custom-batch
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Usually **not needed**. If misconfigured, the Job may **not detect its own Pods**.

### Use Case:
- Running multiple Jobs with custom pod labels

---

## üßÆ 7. `spec.completionMode`

Specifies how the Job calculates completion.

### Types:
- `NonIndexed` (default): All Pods are equal.
- `Indexed`: Each Pod gets an **index (0 to N-1)**.

```yaml
completionMode: Indexed
```

### Indexed Mode Details:
Pods get their index via:
- Annotation: `batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index`
- Label: `batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index`
- Env Var: `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX`
- Hostname: `<job-name>-<index>`

### Use Case:
- **Partitioned computation**
- Worker coordination using deterministic indexes

---

## üí° Lab Example: Complex Indexed Job
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: indexed-example
spec:
  parallelism: 3
  completions: 6
  backoffLimit: 2
  completionMode: Indexed
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: partition-worker
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: compute
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo My index is $JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX"]
        env:
        - name: JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index']
      restartPolicy: Never
```

### Use Case:
- 6 Workers each compute a **different chunk** of data (index 0‚Äì5).
- Up to 3 Pods can run simultaneously.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Set `restartPolicy: Never` unless container-level retries are needed.
- Use `Indexed` for shard-based processing.
- Avoid using `selector` unless advanced customization is needed.
- Use `backoffLimit` to control retry behavior.
- Observe Job status via:
  ```bash
  kubectl get jobs
  kubectl describe job <job-name>
  kubectl logs jobs/<job-name>
  ```
