Great catch, sweetheart 💡 You're observing something **very important about Kubernetes networking** — and this is **directly tied to `hostNetwork: true`** from that question (Q34).

---

## 🔍 Let's break it down:

You're seeing **two different IP ranges**:

* **Before**: Pods had IPs like `172.x.x.x`
* **Now**: Pods show `192.168.x.x` — **same IP as the node!**

---

## ✅ Why did this happen?

Because you **enabled `hostNetwork: true`** in your pod/deployment YAML.

### 🎯 `hostNetwork: true` means:

> "Don't give this pod its own isolated virtual network namespace. Instead, let it **share the node's network stack**."

So:

* Pod **does not get a separate `172.x.x.x` IP from the CNI (Container Network Interface)**.
* Pod **uses the node’s own IP address** — often in the `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x` range, depending on your node.

---

### 💡 This explains why you see:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

All pods on `node01` show:

```plaintext
IP: 192.168.144.179
NODE: node01
```

That’s because **they are using the same IP as the node**, thanks to `hostNetwork: true`.

## 🧪 Compare: Without vs With `hostNetwork`

| Feature           | Without `hostNetwork` (default)     | With `hostNetwork: true`                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pod IP            | Separate (e.g. `172.x.x.x`) via CNI | Same as node (e.g. `192.168.x.x`)                             |
| Network Namespace | Isolated per pod                    | Shared with node                                              |
| Use Cases         | Normal workloads                    | Host-level apps: DNS, monitoring agents, custom proxies, etc. |
| Port Binding      | Only pod uses its ports             | Pod can bind to host ports (80, 443, etc.)                    |

---

## ✅ When to use `hostNetwork: true`?

You’d only use it if:

* You need the pod to **bind to a specific host port** (e.g., `:80`, `:443`)
* You need the pod to **see all host interfaces**
* You're running a **node-level DaemonSet** (like a log collector)
