Sure! Here's the more detailed explanation of the --hard and --scopes options for the kubectl create quota command with a table for common scope values:

# Understanding `kubectl create quota` Command: `--hard` and `--scopes` Options

In Kubernetes, when you're managing resource quotas, you can set limits for various resources within your namespace using the `kubectl create quota` command. Two important options within this command are `--hard` and `--scopes`.

### 1. **`--hard` Option**
The `--hard` option is used to specify the resource limits for a `ResourceQuota` object. These limits define the maximum amount of resources that a namespace can use. The `--hard` option expects a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, where each key is the resource name and the value is the limit you want to set.

#### **Example:**
```bash
kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=cpu=2,memory=4Gi,pods=10
In this example:

cpu: Limits the CPU usage to 2 cores.

memory: Limits memory usage to 4Gi.

pods: Limits the number of pods to 10 in the namespace.

You can set limits for different resources such as cpu, memory, pods, services, replicas, and many others.

2. --scopes Option
The --scopes option allows you to define specific scopes for the resource quota. Scopes determine what kind of resources are included under the quota. The most common scopes are Terminating, NotTerminating, and BestEffort.

Common Scopes:
Scope Name	Description
BestEffort	Applies to resources that are not guaranteed (i.e., those without resource requests). It can be considered as "best-effort" resources that may be evicted if necessary.
Terminating	Applies to resources that are part of the process of terminating a resource (e.g., pods that are terminating). This ensures that resources in the process of being cleaned up donâ€™t count toward the quota.
NotTerminating	Excludes resources that are in the process of being terminated. Useful for focusing on active resources only.
Example:
bash

Edit
kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=cpu=2,memory=4Gi,pods=10 --scopes=NotTerminating
In this example:

--hard: Sets limits on resources (cpu, memory, pods).

--scopes: Limits the scope to only NotTerminating resources, excluding resources that are terminating.

3. Combination of --hard and --scopes
You can combine both --hard and --scopes options to fine-tune your resource quota management.

Example:
bash

Edit
kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=cpu=4,memory=8Gi,pods=20 --scopes=BestEffort,NotTerminating
In this example:

The resource quota is set with limits (cpu, memory, pods).

The scopes include both BestEffort and NotTerminating, meaning the quota will apply to best-effort resources and non-terminating resources only.

Summary of Common --scopes Values:
Scope Value	Description
BestEffort	Applies to resources without requests (non-guaranteed resources).
Terminating	Applies to resources being terminated.
NotTerminating	Applies to resources that are not terminating.
Final Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl create quota my-quota --hard=cpu=4,memory=10Gi,pods=15 --scopes=BestEffort,NotTerminating
In this example:

Limits are defined for cpu, memory, and pods.

Scope is set to BestEffort and NotTerminating, which means only the best-effort and active resources are considered under the quota.

Conclusion
By using --hard and --scopes with the kubectl create quota command, you can effectively manage and limit the resource usage in a Kubernetes namespace, ensuring that your cluster resources are used efficiently and within predefined limits.
