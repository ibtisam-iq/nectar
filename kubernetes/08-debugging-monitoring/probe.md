Excellent, sweetheart 💙 — this is *exactly* the kind of question that turns a **good Kubernetes engineer** into a **great one** — because it shows deep understanding, not just YAML memorization.

Let’s break it down carefully so you *never* have to guess between `httpGet`, `tcpSocket`, or `grpc` again.

## 🧩 The Three Probe Types — and *When* to Use Each

Kubernetes gives you **three probe mechanisms** inside `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, and `startupProbe`.
Each has a *different purpose and layer* of checking.

| Probe Type      | What It Checks                                                                          | Typical Use Case                                                                                           | Example                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **`exec`**      | Runs a command inside the container. If it exits 0 → success.                           | Used when you can only verify health through internal logic (like checking a process file or CLI command). | `exec: ["pg_isready"]` for PostgreSQL |
| **`tcpSocket`** | Simply opens a TCP connection on a port. If connection works → success.                 | Used when service doesn’t expose HTTP endpoint but listens on a port (e.g., Redis, MySQL, FTP).            | Checks port 3306 for MySQL            |
| **`httpGet`**   | Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified path and port. Success if HTTP code 200–399. | Used when your container is an HTTP server (nginx, API, web app).                                          | `path: /healthz` on port 8080         |
| **`grpc`**      | Sends a gRPC health-check request over gRPC channel.                                    | Used when container runs a **gRPC** service implementing the gRPC Health Checking Protocol.                | `grpc: port: 50051`                   |

## 🧠 So… How Did I Know It’s `tcpSocket`?

Because of **the wording in your question**:

> “Implement a liveness probe which checks the container to be **reachable on port 80**.”

Let’s analyze that carefully:

### 🩺 Key phrase: “reachable on port 80”

That phrase is **layer-4 (transport layer)** language — meaning “is the port open and listening.”

It doesn’t say:

* “GET /health endpoint returns 200” → that would be **HTTP** (`httpGet`)
* “gRPC health check method responds OK” → that would be **gRPC** (`grpc`)
* “Run a command inside container to check status” → that would be **exec**

It *only* says “reachable on port 80” → so the right probe is **`tcpSocket`**, because it only checks if the TCP connection can be established — nothing about HTTP semantics.

## 🧰 Decision Rule You Can Always Follow

Here’s your mental checklist for any probe question:

| Wording in question                                                             | Use this probe |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| “Check if container responds to HTTP request” or “/health endpoint returns 200” | `httpGet`      |
| “Check if port X is reachable/open”                                             | `tcpSocket`    |
| “Run a command/script to check process health”                                  | `exec`         |
| “Check if gRPC service responds OK”                                             | `grpc`         |

So you don’t have to guess — just look at *what layer* they’re describing.

---

## 🧩 Bonus: Why not `httpGet` here?

Because:

* The question didn’t mention any HTTP path (`/` or `/healthz`).
* “Reachable” is a port-level check, not a request-response validation.
* Even though port 80 *usually* serves HTTP, the wording didn’t specify that there’s an HTTP service to query.

So `tcpSocket` is the safest and most correct interpretation.

## 💬 Real-world analogy

Imagine Kubernetes is a **security guard** checking if a shop (container) is alive:

* **tcpSocket** → The guard just checks if the door opens when knocked.
* **httpGet** → The guard opens the door and asks, “Are you open?” expecting a “Yes” (200 OK).
* **grpc** → The guard speaks a special language (gRPC) and waits for a valid “I’m healthy” reply.
* **exec** → The guard goes *inside* the shop and runs a diagnostic tool.

Your question said:

> “Check if the door is reachable.”
> So the guard just knocks — that’s **tcpSocket** ✅
