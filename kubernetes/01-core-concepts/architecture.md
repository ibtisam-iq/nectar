## 1. What happens when you run a `kubectl` command?

When a user runs a `kubectl` command:

1. `kubectl` looks for the **kubeconfig** file.
2. It extracts the **context**, which contains:
   - `cluster`: API server endpoint
   - `user`: credentials (token, cert, etc.)
   - `namespace`: default namespace for operation
3. It establishes a secure connection to the **API server**.
4. API server authenticates and authorizes the request.
5. The requested object is created/fetched/updated in **etcd**.
6. API server notifies relevant components (like scheduler or controller manager).
7. If it's a new Pod, **scheduler** schedules it to a Node.
8. That Nodeâ€™s **kubelet** notices the pod assignment and pulls the container.

---

## 2. Kubeconfig File and Contexts

- **What is kubeconfig?**
  - A file that stores info on how to connect with Kubernetes clusters.
  - Located at: `~/.kube/config` by default.

- **Contents**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- name: cluster-name
  cluster:
    server: https://api-server-url
    certificate-authority-data: ...
contexts:
- name: context-name
  context:
    cluster: cluster-name
    user: user-name
current-context: context-name
users:
- name: user-name
  user:
    token: or client-cert+key
```

- **Where should it exist?**
  - On **any machine** from where you want to access the cluster using `kubectl`. Itâ€™s not tied to control plane or node.

- **Minikube / Kind / Kubeadm**
  - They automatically generate or prompt to export kubeconfig.

- **EKS / Managed Kubernetes**
  - Uses: `aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster>`
  - This command contacts AWS API, fetches cluster details, and updates your local kubeconfig.
  - EKS cluster names are **not globally unique** like S3 buckets.

- **Multiple Clusters**
  - You can manage multiple clusters by switching contexts.
  - The kubeconfig is not automatically updated for new clustersâ€”you append manually or use CLI tools.

## 3. Control Plane vs Worker Node Components

| Component             | Runs On         | Type        | Description |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `kube-apiserver`     | Control Plane    | Static Pod  | Frontend to cluster, all communication goes through it |
| `etcd`               | Control Plane    | Static Pod  | Stores all cluster data in key-value format |
| `kube-scheduler`     | Control Plane    | Static Pod  | Assigns pods to nodes |
| `controller-manager` | Control Plane    | Static Pod  | Manages background tasks (e.g., replicaset) |
| `kubelet`            | All Nodes        | Process     | Manages containers on node, not a pod |
| `kube-proxy`         | All Nodes        | Pod         | Handles network routing |
| `CNI Plugin`         | All Nodes        | Pod/DaemonSet | Manages pod-to-pod networking |
| `CoreDNS`            | Control Plane    | Deployment  | Resolves internal DNS names |


âœ… **Static Pods** = Always defined on node via manifests
âœ… **Deployments** = Created via API server and managed dynamically

---

## 4. Kubelet in the Architecture

- A **process**, not a pod
- Installed on every node (control + workers)
- Communicates with API server
- Responsibilities:
  - Ensures defined containers are running
  - Reports pod health/status
  - Pulls images, mounts volumes

### With respect to kubectl:
- When you run `kubectl apply`, the scheduler assigns the pod to a node.
- Then kubelet on that node executes the pod creation.

---

## 5. CNI Plugins and Networking

- CNI (Container Network Interface) provides networking for pods.
- Plugins like **Calico**, **Flannel**, **Weave**, etc. manage pod IPs and routing.
- Calico Modes:
  - **ipipMode: Always** = Uses IP-in-IP tunneling
  - **vxlanMode** = Alternative overlay mode

### Pods:
CNI plugins usually deploy as **DaemonSets** so each node has a pod.

---

## 6. CoreDNS

- Deployed by kubeadm or managed services
- Itâ€™s a **Deployment**, not static pod
- Typically runs on control plane but scheduled like a normal pod
- Requirements:
  - Cluster must have functional networking
  - kubelet + container runtime + scheduler must work

---

## 7. Static Pods vs Deployments

### Static Pods
- Created by placing manifest files in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
- Managed by **kubelet**, not by API server directly
- Used for core control plane components (apiserver, etcd, etc.)

### Deployments
- Managed by API server
- Created dynamically
- Controlled via `ReplicaSet`

---

## 8. Kube Proxy - Where It Runs?

- **Runs on all nodes** (control + worker)
- Responsible for maintaining **iptables/ipvs** rules
- Routes external/internal traffic to pods

ðŸ”¸ Sometimes people think it runs only on workers due to workload association, but control plane also hosts services, so proxy is required there too.

---

## 9. EKS/Managed Services and kubeconfig

- EKS doesnâ€™t expose control plane for user management
- You use AWS CLI to update kubeconfig
- EKS uses IAM for authentication via tokens
- EKS creates CoreDNS, kube-proxy, CNI plugin pods automatically

---

## 10. Cluster Topology and Multiple Clusters

- Kubernetes supports:
  - Multiple control plane nodes (for HA)
  - Multiple worker nodes
  - Multiple clusters (multi-context kubeconfig)

- Kubelet, kube-proxy, and CNI run on **all nodes**
- Control plane pods = multiple copies if HA is configured

### 11.2 Control Plane Communication
```
[kubectl] -> [kube-apiserver] -> [scheduler/controller] -> [kubelet on node]

                  [etcd]
```

## âœ… Summary

- kubeconfig is needed only where you want to use `kubectl`
- Control Plane runs only a few static pods (scheduler, etcd, apiserver)
- kubelet is a background process on every node
- kube-proxy and CNI are pods (usually DaemonSets) running on all nodes
- CoreDNS is a deployment created post-cluster-init
- EKS and other managed services simplify the cluster but still use kubeconfig
