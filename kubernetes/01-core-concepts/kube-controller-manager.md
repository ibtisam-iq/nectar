## 🧠 What is `kube-controller-manager`?

> It is the **automation engine** of Kubernetes.

It runs **dozens of controllers**, such as:

* Node controller (detects node failure)
* Replication controller (ensures right number of pod replicas)
* Service account controller
* Token controller
* Persistent volume binder
* Garbage collector
* Job controller
* Many more...

**In short:** When something deviates from the desired state, controllers act to bring it back.

## 🔹 KEY FLAGS — Deep Explanation

---

### ✅ `--allocate-node-cidrs=true`

📌 **Purpose:**
Tells the controller-manager to **assign CIDR ranges** (IP ranges) to nodes for pod IPs.

🧠 Required for `--cluster-cidr` (next flag). This is mostly used in **cloud-native CNI** like Calico, Weave, etc.

---

### ✅ `--authentication-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf`

### ✅ `--authorization-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf`

### ✅ `--kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf`

🔐 All of these deal with API communication:

| Flag                 | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `authentication-...` | Proves identity of controller-manager             |
| `authorization-...`  | Defines what it's allowed to do                   |
| `kubeconfig`         | General API client config (endpoint, certs, etc.) |

All use the same file (`controller-manager.conf`).

---

### ✅ `--bind-address=127.0.0.1`

Locks down the API server listener to **localhost** only (security best practice). You’ll see this for all control plane components.

---

### ✅ `--client-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt`

📜 Verifies **client certs** presented by other components. Only trusted clients are allowed to connect.

---

### ✅ `--cluster-cidr=172.17.0.0/16`

🌐 **Defines** the IP address range allocated for pods across the cluster.

Example:

* If Node A gets 172.17.1.0/24
* Node B gets 172.17.2.0/24
* All pods get IPs from this pool

Required for:

* IP assignment logic
* Network policies

---

### ✅ `--cluster-name=kubernetes`

A label for multi-cluster federation. Mostly defaults to `kubernetes`. Rarely changed.

---

### ✅ `--cluster-signing-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt`

### ✅ `--cluster-signing-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key`

🔐 Used to **sign certificates** automatically during:

* Node bootstrapping
* CSR approvals (if automated)
* Service accounts

This is how Kubernetes offers **internal certificate management**.

---

### ✅ `--controllers=*,bootstrapsigner,tokencleaner`

Controls which controllers run.

* `*` means: **Run all default controllers**
* `bootstrapsigner`: Signs bootstrap tokens used by new nodes
* `tokencleaner`: Periodically removes expired tokens

You can **disable controllers** if needed in custom setups, like:

```bash
--controllers=*,-garbagecollector
```

---

### ✅ `--requestheader-client-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt`

📨 Used when the API server is fronted by a **proxy** (e.g., kube-aggregator). This CA validates incoming requests via proxy headers.

---

### ✅ `--root-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt`

📎 Injected into service account secrets as `ca.crt`.

* Lets pods **verify the identity** of the kube-apiserver.
* Ensures secure communication.

---

### ✅ `--service-account-private-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.key`

🔑 Used to **sign service account tokens**, so the kube-apiserver can validate them.

* Every pod with a service account gets a token.
* This token is signed by this key.

---

### ✅ `--service-cluster-ip-range=172.20.0.0/16`

🎯 Defines the IP range for **ClusterIP Services**.

* Every Kubernetes Service gets a virtual IP from this pool.
* Must not overlap with pod CIDRs.

---

### ✅ `--use-service-account-credentials=true`

🔐 Ensures that **individual controllers use service account tokens** (rather than the main kubeconfig).

Security Best Practice:
→ Each controller acts under its own identity with limited permissions.

---

## 🔹 HEALTH CHECKS

### ✅ `startupProbe` and `livenessProbe`

* Both check: `https://127.0.0.1:10257/healthz`
* Periodically monitored by kubelet.
* Failure triggers restart.

⚠️ These endpoints are **only accessible locally**.

---

## 🔹 VOLUME MOUNTS

| Volume                                                | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/etc/kubernetes/pki`                                 | Contains all certs and keys   |
| `/etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf`             | Kubeconfig file               |
| `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec` | For legacy FlexVolume plugins |
| `/etc/ssl/certs`, `/etc/ca-certificates`, etc.        | Standard Linux CA locations   |

All these allow controller-manager to:

* Talk securely to the API server
* Access CA certificates
* Sign tokens and CSRs

## 🔹 OTHER IMPORTANT FIELDS

| Field                                     | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hostNetwork: true`                       | Shares host's network stack. Needed for localhost binding to work. |
| `priorityClassName: system-node-critical` | Ensures highest scheduling priority. Won't be evicted easily.      |
| `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`          | Enables syscall filtering for better security.                     |
